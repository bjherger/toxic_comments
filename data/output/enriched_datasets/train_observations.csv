Fair use rationale for Image:321b.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:321b.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too.

As a nonspecialist in this field, I'm wondering if anyone can explain the information presented in section starting on p.2, From The Countries Viewpoint of this source EllenCT posted. 
Although the source is arguing for more funding for vocational programs as opposed to liberal arts in light of much greater overall ROI, in order to make its case it presents ROI stats for both, and to a novice like me it seems that the stats may support the statement pertaining to ROI from subsidies in terms of tax receipts. 
In short, the table shows an ROI of 30%/yr (""""BA in English""""), and though I'm not exactly sure how that translates, given the inclusion of """"incremental jobs"""" and """"incremental income"""", etc., it does seem to represent some correlation between the subsidies and tax returns.

 Appeal 

I think your treatment of me has been a little unfair. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.
My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).
I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.
Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.
I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.
I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.
I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.
I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.
I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a rea",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi, another few points about the second subtitle: """"Would the preparations have been effective?"""".  I argue that this subtitle is too long. The subtitle """"Historical analysis"""" would be more concise. As well, professional historians do not usually devote time to """"counter factual"""" discussions, like """"Would the US forces in Hawaii been able to withstand an amphibious assault by Japanese forces in WW II"""", or """"If it had not been rainy in 1415, would the French knights have won at the Battle of Agincourt, rather than being trapped in the mud"""".  Historians don't spend time discussing these issues. In 1415, during the battle of Agincourt, it WAS muddy, and so the French knights DID get bogged down in the mud, and so that is the course of the battle. I would like to see a source indicating that reputable historians have discussed """"Would the preparations have been effective.""""

Your make a good point.  Let me first address it from the perspective of Marshall Hodgson.

Civilization is a somewhat arbitrary term, often narrowly defined by language.  This obviously has its limits.  On the other hand, the more broadly you define a civilization, the more subgroupings it must include.  Eventually, we come to see civilizations as groupings useful for the purpose at hand.  And ultimately, civilizations, like religions, are self-defined.

Hodgson considers the lands of Islam to constitute a world civilization.  He calls Islam a world civilization in the title of his book The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization.

For another perspective, I can turn to H. Patrick Glenn, in Legal Traditions of the World, speaking on tradition and identity.  Not all is arbitrary in the definition of a tradition, or civilization.

Glenn quotes Fernand Braudel, who speaks of an """"underlying structure"""" of civilization; """"those elements of a civilization which could not be changed without a fundamental change, or more probably disappearance, of the tradition itself.""""  Applying this criteria to Islamic civilization, one immediately understands that structure to be the religion of Islam.

To summarize: looking at the lands of Islam, with its concept of Umma, the shared traditions, the shared Arabic religious and often secular language, and indeed the shared religion of Islam, it seems logical to fall in with those who perceive the outline of a world Islamic civilization.

Obviously I disagree with the note about the photographs. The term """"graphic"""" tends to inappropriately stigmatize the nature of the photography.

They are scientifically relevant and in no way should be associated with things like pornography or """"grpahic"""" sexuality that somme cultures consider inappropriate for some audience. Noting that they are Surgical photos makes their content emphatically clear for anyone who might not be emotionally or psychologically mature enough to view them.

 Breast_implant

If you took the time to read the entirety of the information Anne Lawrence, MD provides on Dr. Metlzer's work and techniques, you will see that his origination of his techhniques and procedures are documented there. See also the referenced article by Takta, LL and Meltzer, TR, in pubmed. I believe this article is being held to a ridiculous and unfair standard, that is not representative of the wikipedia. I believe that the microscopic treatment this article has received is evidence of bias against its subject matter, while the simple fact is clear that this surgeon is referenced repeatedly in other wikipedia articles about related surgical topics. In  addition, the very nature of the subject matter should be protected a topic given the level of bigotry, discrimination, and violence including murder against people who receive these medical treatments. The very fact that a surgeon like Toby Meltzer, with such a prestigious medical background, chooses to concentrate on such service to other people, who have few if any equally qualified alternatives, is notable by itself, without need for any further citation. These surgeries are in and of themselves pioneering, and largely non-existent on any measurable scale before the 1960s.

In addition to lacking a biography for Emperor Ling of Han, the Records of the Three Kingdoms carry no biography for Emperor Shao or Emperor Xian of Han. None of the Han ruling house have biographies in the book. By your own logic, gauge00, this means the Records of the Three Kingdoms cannot be said to start until 220, which is clearly false. I will state again that carrying a person's biography is neither a sufficient nor necessary condition for recording events that occurred during their lifetime.

All links regarding prostaglandins and sexual behavior/development are relevant to the discussion of whether sexual orientation is determined from birth.

Recently, epitestosterone and the T/E ratio have received a great deal of attention in the press, and given that the upswing of endocrine research on homosexuals started with a paper that found significantly lowered excretion of testosterone and epitestosterone in homosexual men, the GLBT community should be aware of this research (see Endocrine Function in Male and Female Homosexuals, Loraine et al. 1970; and Sex Hormones and Male Homosexuality, Meyer-Bahlburg 1977).",0,0,0,0,0,0

I didn't realise that the losses were so bad that the entire legion had to be reformed from scratch, and that the *replacement* 9th Legion appeared to have been wiped out some time later. 
Also, re Lang Vei, I was looking for accounts that tell the story from the Vietnamese point of view - there's lots of stuff on various heroics by Americans, but nothing about how the battle was planned and executed by the Vietnamese. This would tie in nicely with your Night Combat, because clearly it was an attack designed to use the night as a tactical advantage. And the use of tanks was a fairly radical departure in that context. I'm guessing the US forces must have been aware that tanks were in the area, because there were around 100 LAWs rockets issued to the base, but the preparedness for armoured attack is also not really covered in the article except to say they 'weren't ready' for such an attack. This doesn't make much sense - if they were issued with a huge ile of anti-tank weapons then they *must* have expected such attacks? Again, it would be useful to hear from the Vietnamese on their opponents preparedness or otherwise. Normally of course, the history is written by the victors - but not in this instance!

Nor did I state that the substance of that quote needs to be placed in the article.  That quote was used as my rationale in arriving at my conclusion that the robbery is germane to the article.  Whether or not the robbery is germane to the article is the exact topic of this Talk Page thread.  So, stop accusing people (i.e., me) of inappropriate conduct.   That's twice now.  I am doing exactly what this Talk Page is intended for.  Don't tell me what quotes and what topics and what content I can or cannot use in supporting my arguments.  Also, stop putting words in people's (i.e., my) mouth.  If it continues, I am taking further action.   Thanks.

 I followed the links to an article on """"consensus decision making"""". The entire article seemed to me to be on the simplistic side (perhaps due to my ongoing research in Organizational Communication), but it had a section on """"Quaker decision making."""" I don't know if it would be appropriate to link back here (sort of a 360 degree thing), but it certainly is relevant. 

 Perhaps an article on """"Quaker meetings"""" might be worth considering? I'm thinking in terms of examining several types of Quaker meetings (clearness, weddings, threshing, as well as business) in light of Quaker philosophies or traditional practices. Put another way, I am growing increasingly sensitive to cataloging """"weird Quaker ways of doing things"""" in a de-contextualized sense. Perhaps we would be better off discussing how the Quakers' beliefs led to these different ways of meeting? 

 Some suggestiongs: 
Universal ministry (everyone a minister), 
immediate access (not mediated by Priest or ecclesiastical structure), 
privileging peacemaking (refusing to accept any sort of social darwinism in which the strongor aggressively vocalprevail), and 
testimony of integrity (challenging participants to put beliefs into actions, even if it leads to unconventional methods)

 It doesn't have to be an apologetic for Quaker practices, but it would help explain why these practices are held so closely by Quakers, even of dramatically different theologies.

 And thank you all, for putting up with my """"bull in a china shop"""" entrance. My entries could have been read as patronizing and as assuming that I was the only """"real"""" Quaker present. I did not intend to communicate that; I am sorry. I suppose that several Quaker sensibilities were at work even here, among the tools and spare parts! Thank you for your gracious patience, all.

 Arundhati Roy's controversial comments on Gujarat riots in 2002 missing in """"Advocacy and controversy"""" section 

Hi,

Arundhati Roy's comments on Gujarat riots of 2002 that came in Outlook magazine when the riots were happening, which got very high media attention, when the enquiry proved false and subsequent apology was published in the same magazine, are one of the biggest controversial statement ever issued by her, which triggered widespread violence during the riots, is missing from """"Advocacy and controversy"""" section of the wikipedia article about 'Arundhati Roy"""".

Some of the comments in the article published in the Outlook magazine were 

""""Last night a friend from Baroda called. Weeping. It took her fifteen minutes to tell me what the matter was. It wasn't very complicated. Only that Sayeeda, a friend of hers, had been caught by a mob. Only that her stomach had been ripped open and stuffed with burning rags. Only that after she died, someone carved 'OM' on her forehead.""""

""""A mob surrounded the house of former Congress MP Iqbal Ehsan Jaffri. His phone calls to the Director-General of Police, the Police Commissioner, the Chief Secretary, the Additional Chief Secretary (Home) were ignored. The mobile police vans around his house did not intervene. The mob broke into the house. They stripped his daughters and burned them alive. Then they beheaded Ehsan Jaffri and dismembered him. Of course it's only a coincidence that Jaffri was a trenchant critic of Gujarat Chief Minister, Narendra Modi, during his campaign for the Rajkot Assembly by-election in February.""""

That is irrelevant to be honest, because Lucy is one of the shows longest-running characters. Lucy has been in the show since 1993 and Kathy was in the show and a prominent figure in her life from 1993 until 2000. You can say her 'own storylines' but that is a false choice. Her storylines started from when she came on the show for eg. the custody battle. You are really making a false distinction. I urge you to watch the videos, please. You cannot make that argument. The difference between Den Watts and Kathy Beale is that Den Watts was dead when Denny was born, Kathy was alive and an influential figure in Lucy and et al's life until her departure.

Watch the clip. Welling himself didn't say anything about being considered for the role, just that him and Ratner discussed it and acknowledged the scheduling conflict. His last statement was that he didn't know if he was being considered or if it was just for comparison purposes. Nevermind, I see that you were just revert in mass dose and didn't see that. My bad.  

No problem. Corrected for it. –  (Talk | contribs) 

Yeah, I saved the page and immediately saw that you had gone back and corrected it. My apologies.  

 Superman 
Ok, so what is your opinion on this """"preceeded by"""". I started a discussion, but it seems to be between me and one other person that they lag in their response time. If you could take a look, if you haven't already, I'd appreciate another opinion.  

I do believe I am going to need your help on this """"preceeded by"""" section from other users (namely the last two that have posted on the TALK PAGE for the article). Not only for Superman Returns, but also for the previos Supe movies that they have edited to say that Superman Returns Follows Superman II, and that Superman Lives follows Superman IV.  

I appreciate your help with these articles, and with the """"protection"""" that was placed. It amazes me that these people don't understand simple definitions. I feel like I'm trying to explain something to a 5 year old. You tell what is really going on and they still stick to what they are talking about because that's all they know. Anyway, Thank again for all the help.  

Yeah, I'm glad it went up quick, otherwise we would have had to deal with Superman II as the Preceeding film till it was up. Well, I can finally get some rest without having to worry about those children.  

Didn't you say Kitty's name was spelled Kosawlski? or however that other person was spelling it?? I thought I saw you say that, and you changed it, but now it seems as though you are going with Koslowski. How was it spelled in the credits?  

Ok, cause I didn't know if I had read you wrong and you were really saying it was Koslowski. Right now it's sitting at Koslowski, being redirected from Kowalski. What we have to do is find the ones that are resticting the correct name and put them up for deletion. Then, after they have been deleted, we can assume the proper name.",0,0,0,0,0,0

In the original German was a sentence, """"Vor dem Dalang liegt auch kein Bananenstrunk, der die Puppen aufnimmt, sondern ein Plangkan (eine Art Tisch mit Löchern in der Tischplatte), auf dem die benötigten Puppen bereit gestellt werden.""""

I am changing this to simply , """"In front of the Dalang is a Plangkan (a type of table with holes punched in its surface), on which the necessary puppets sit ready for use. 

I think (but am not certain) that the that the untranslated part is more or less a joke: roughly, that there what is on the table is not a foo foo drink for the puppets. If anyone with better German than me thinks I'm wrong and there is something more substantial here, please restore the appropriate phrase. Thanks.

 

Another sentence with which I had trouble: Die Figuren dieser Schattenspiele waren Wayang Golek (normale Kopfgestalt durch einen da-mit verbundenen Stab auf dem Rumpf drehbar. Arme durch je ein Stab, der an der Hand befestigt ist beweglich) , geschnitzte, bemalte und bekleidete Figuren, die an Fäden gezogen wurden, Malereien auf Schautafeln oder geweihte und verkleidete Menschen.

I've rendered this """"The figures in these puppet plays were wayang golek (normally a head assembly connected by a straight stick to a trunk, allowing the head to swivel. Arms were attached to a separate staff, allowing hand motions), carved, painted and dressed figures, manipulated via threads or strings, painted dioramas or sanctified and dressed humans,"""" but that may not be quite right. If you know better, please correct the article (and make a note here that you've done so).   18:03, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Your translation seems OK. Geweihte could also mean """"horned"""", which would make sense in the case of demons. """"Sanctified"""", as in """"blessed"""", makes less sense in the context.  12:44, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Another tricky one: Wayang-Klitik-Figuren meist erheblich beschädigt, sehr zum Gaudium der Zuschauer..."""" I haven't even ventured a translation for this, it has several words I don't properly know. Is Gaudium perhaps the Latin word, as in """"gaudeamus igitur""""?   18:03, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)  This has now been satisfactorily rendered.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)

Another problematic sentence: Aus diesem Grunde haben Wayang-Klitik-Figuren, die zu Spielen herangezogen werden und dort Kampfszenen zu durchstehen haben, Arme aus Leder. I currently have this partially translated as """"On this basis the wayang klitik figures have, die zu Spielen herangezogen werden and where battle scenes zu durchstehen haben, leather arms."""" I know that durchstehen is to stand one's ground, but I still can't fully translate the sentence.   18:17, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)  This has now been satisfactorily rendered.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)

And another: Aus Jenggala und Kediri stammen die Geschichten von Raden Panji und Cindelaras, die ein paar Dorfjungen mit ihren Kampfhähnen erleben. The first part is """"From Jenggala and Kediri come the stories of Raden Panji and Cindelara,"""" I'm not at all clear on the latter part. My dictionary says Kampfhähnen are literally fighting cocks, but can just be pugnacious people.   19:46, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)
 Someone else has now simply rendered this as fighting cocks, but I'd consider that suspect (since one can't tell from the original German). I'd like to find a more primary source before considering this necessarily correct.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)
 I translated it as I did, because it explicitly says """"the boys with their X"""", and not somthing like """"the two x-like boys"""".  12:44, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

An interesting link: Wooden puppet is performed almost the same way as the wayang kulit, but there is no screen in front of the puppeteer, and no banana trunk to stuck the wayang. In stead a 'Plangkan' (permanent wooden table with holes) to support the wooden puppets is used.''
 12:52, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

 Hmm. Looks like we could have a copyvio on our hands. That would really be a pain after so much work went into a translation. I'm not sure quite what to do with this...   02:30, Jun 6, 2004 (UTC)

None: Beefart replies

Thanks for you comments. Few take the time to discuss grammar on Wikipedia and it shows in many articles. I disagree with you about 'none'. The word comes from the Old Norse ne an, which means, literally """"no one"""". In my view, to get the sense of any usage of 'none' we must expand it in our minds to """"no one"""". It is impossible to say """"no one are dinosaurs"""". It has to be """"no one is a dinosaur"""". Here are two examples from the OED: (E.J. Howard): Except for her eyes, none of her features was remarkable. (P. Rose): People sought her... but none was a companion. HOWEVER, the plot thickens, because the OED also gives this example from Graham Greene, who is highly regarded as a writer: None of our wives are invited. This flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the OED has given up the fight. Maybe I ought to as well ) ). There are of course some situations where expanding """"none"""" to """"no one"""" does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. (e.g. None of the increase is due to...). Here the best we can hope for is to propose that """"none"""" is a synonym for """"nothing"""". I personally try to avoid expressions such as """"None of the increase"""" and would be inclined to write """"No part of the increase""""... """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The editor who fears that the inclusion of facts about Oswald's claim of being made a patsy by the use of fabricated evidence and then being silenced by murder, has received support from another editor by the name of  Mr. Harris. (See, above) Mr. Harris argues the beliefs there was a plot to kill the president, and that Oswald was set up, is similar to believing the earth is flat. 

No Mr. Harris, you are out of step with the modern world. In 1979, a Congressional Committee engaged in a three year study and determined that Kennedy was probably murdered as a result of a conspiracy, and in 2003 only 22% of Americans agree with you. Mr. Harris, you are clinging to the past in the face of overwhelming information to the contrary that is slowly being made public as more and more documents are declassified.  Sometimes one has to question old beliefsnot try to delete facts from books that disprove ones old beliefs. 

Congress enacted federal legislation in 1992 to open up the mass of secret government records about the assassination. The Assassination Records Review Board points out that not many people agree with Mr. Harris:

""""The American public has expressed its dissatisfaction with both the work and the conclusions of the official investigations of the assassination and it was this dissatisfaction that was primarily responsible for Congress' initiative to establish the Assassination Records Review Board (Review Board). Section 3(2) of the JFK Act defines the records of each of these official investigative entities as assassination records. As such, the Review Board worked to review and release all records that these investigative entities used in reaching their conclusions about the assassination.""""

Mr. Harris it won't help you cause to argue that everyone but you is dumb, a """"flat-earth believer"""", or must be sheltered from the facts. Please, just stop deleting facts from the articles. The old viewpoint that you want to believe is in the article. But, you’re not
satisfied. You want to keep out the evidence that makes your position to look improbable, but the web site rules forbid you deleting such information.

In the case of a rape victim, the family can reveal the name and the family of Nirbhaya did. However the juvenile isn't allowed ti be named under Juvenile Justice Act. Additionally the victimisation and probable threat on his life if his name is revealed also makes another case why his name shouldn't be there whether the name the sources gave might be wrong or true.

 Needs references, balance 

Hello. I'd like to suggest some edits. I tried editing Wikipedia a long time ago and had a terrible experience, and I can't even remember the protocol since it's been so long, so I thought it'd be safer to post suggestions here and let someone else who's more in the know roll with them if they'd like to.

 The introduction states, """"The prescribing labels of some SSRIs note the possibility of 'intolerable' discontinuation reactions. Some patients have extreme difficulty discontinuing use of SSRI drugs.""""  Not only are these claims not referenced, but they're misleading, given that the vast majority of patients, if they experience this syndrome, do not find the reactions intolerable and don't have """"extreme difficulty"""" discontinuing. The introduction also says studies demonstrate """"statistically and clinically significant indications of difficulties with the discontinuing of SSRIs,"""" thus further espousing the difficulties of discontinuing SSRIs without balancing that with the fact that most people don't have major problems.

 In the history section, last paragraph, fluoxetine is said to have """"the highest number of drug dependence reports."""" The WHO site was down when I tried to check the reference, so I don't know what year that report was from or whether it really says people become dependent on fluoxetine (given that the quoted paragraph above this claim, from WHO, seems to dispute that notion), but to my understanding, it's generally accepted that people do not become dependent on antidepressants, in the way that the general public thinks of dependence.

 The controversy section is completely one-sided. Arguments from critics are explained in detail, but the other sides are not. There is no indication that these criticisms are from the minority or have evidence against them.

Overall, parts of this article seem misleading to me, and it concerns me because many myths and baseless fear mongering is out there about antidepressants already. People who are depressed deserve to know the facts, and to understand that these drugs are approved because the benefits far outweigh the risks, according to mainstream medicine. This is literally a life-or-death topic and must be handled in an unbiased manner. I'm obviously not arguing for side effects and concerns to be deleted. I'm urging for them to be presented appropriately, with the weight that most experts believe they actually carryno more and no less.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm typing this with the green-on-black skin on. It mostly works now, if you make sure that in your Monobook.js the variable Gerbrant.hidePane is set to the following value:
 {
     background: """"#000000"""",
     color: """"#00dd00"""",
     selBackground: """"#00dd00"""",
     selColor: """"#000000"""",
     borderColor: """"#00dd00""""
 }
You can for example wrap it in the following, or any other way that's okay in JavaScript. (The rationale behind this settings scheme is that I use various scripts, some of my own, some of which have settings, and some written by others, which may have settings as well, so I wanted to be sure settings for my scripts are in a seperate namespace, where they can't touch or clash with those of other scripts.)
 Gerbrant = {
     hidePane = ...
 }
I may need some time to iron out a little bug, but at least it works. As for the other problem, this is caused by the script's (i.e. my) assumption that either the interwiki list or the toolbox is the last menu. If this isn't true for some reason, things can go wrong. I'll try to fix this if I can find a good test script to work with. Also, if you have suggestions for better colour values or a good way to automagically detect common colour skins like green-on-black so I could select more appropriate defaults, I'd like to hear them.

@ you will do just fine; and Shabaz was """"made"""" to retire as far as my personal opinion is concerned(his is by far the dirtiest dysysop I have witnessed ever). However Dougweller is quite an expert so his input will be valuable. Now to matter at hand. The current version of the article has three basic problems which I will list below. We can discuss them together or separately as you wish. (Code 16 apparently agrees with my other edits, even though he does not wish to state it, I would also like to state that  is quite right, I misunderstood prophetic as being concerned with prophecy at first but I am certain now that it means pertaining to the prophet)
 It has been proven here that Israr Khan is just a non notable run of the mill professor at some Malaysian university who writes self published books. Consensus has already been reached between me and Code16 that he is an unreliable source for content, as is clear from the discussion I linked. So I would like to contest his views being added here, or anywhere else for that matter. 
 Hallaq has been given a new section all by himself without any rationale. He is a western scholar so he should be included with other western scholars and given due weight. To be frank his weight should be LESS than other western scholars, as he is not a scholar of hadith per se. He is a scholar of law/jurisprudence, and as law is based on hadith he is also knowledgeable in hadith. But he cannot compare with other scholars whose main interest was hadith.  
 I would like to contest the creation of """"authenticity"""" subsection. My  argument is that this section is highly misleading. It leads one to assume that other scholars are against hadith for other reason, whereas in reality almost all scholars(both western and eastern) criticize hadith because they consider it as """"inauthentic"""".

For another, the checkuser tables include deleted edits and the sending of emails through the special:email function, neither of which shows up in a quick check of contribs (although deleted edits would show if I looked at both the live and deleted contrib pages).

This confirms my suggestion above that there were 2 groups of FINNI - one in N Scandinavia and one somewhere E of the Vistula. They may or may not have been related: as I explained earlier, the same name is not conclusive evidence of ethnic affiliation. For example, the northern group may have been proto-Sami, while the southern group may have been proto-Finns. Anyway, we can't show the northern group as their habitat is off the map. The question now is where the southern group was located. I have to admit that your suggestion of the upper Vistula region is a more natural reading of Ptolemy III.5. However, it conflicts with the most natural reading of Tacitus G.46, which is that the VENEDI were between the FENNI and the BASTARNAE and I am using Tacitus as the """"default"""" position in this map. I want to do some more research on this one. But one possible compromise is that we could show them in both places with a ? after the name.

{{unblock|1=
Ruslik0 is incorrect in his block of me. I wasn't edit waring as defined by Wikipedia: I made one reversion of an edit today.

Furthermore, Ruslik0 is incorrect that I made a false accusation regarding the objective fact that Jeffro77 is engaging in vandalism: Jeffro77 replaced this entrywhich is very similar to the version that existed there since October 31, 2008, with some improvementswith this entry, giving the excuse in his edit summary of """"WP:FRINGE,"""" which doesn't even make sense as an explanation for his edits: i.e., deletion of a number of citations; deletion of the information on theologian Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg's defense of the theology of the Omega Point Theory; etc. As well, there's no need for the large displayed quote, as the previous entry already stated that Prof. David Deutsch doesn't agree that the Omega Point is God; furthermore, Jeffro77's edit deletes the mention of the fact that Prof. Deutsch endorses the physics of the Omega Point Theory.

In addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""". Whereas the version before was properly cited: """"David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.""""

As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

Additionally, while Jeffro77's """"fringe"""" claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

As well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, """"The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,"""" Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals). The Wikipedia article on the Omega Point Theory lists seven different mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journals in which Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been published (and that's not including the Zygon journal). That is quite a significant amount.

Speedy deletion of Blackstar1985
 A tag has been placed on Blackstar1985 requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the article does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that a copy be emailed to you.     """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 My Conrtibutions to Shady Records 

So I've been asked to consult this page by JrPut or idk his name; but anyway:

The Shady Producers/DJ's list should be updated.
I have valid links for Mr. Porter, Alchemist, Rikanatti, and Luis Resto. The following are all Reliable links, and even though Aftermath Ent. Blog is a blog, we have used it as multible sources on additional articles, and we have also used MTV News as a reliable source, and that in itself is a blog.
 Alchemist 
Luis Resto
Rikanatti
Eminem also acts as a producer for the label, and since he is the founder, CEO, and signed to the label as its main artist, I would presume that linking references for him as a producer is frivalous and uneeded. 

Now, The Bass Brothers and Eminem have ended their working relationship. We have multible sources for this including when Em purchased his new studio, and F.B.T sued Interscope/Aftermath.

However, with that said, we have no additional proof that DJ Head has ended his working relationship with EM. We have no source saying that he has, and unless you supply one, we're going to be leaving him in the active section. Just because a producer didn't release any tracks for the label in a while does not constitute their absence from the label.

So Please, Let me re-add Alchemist, Eminem, Mr. Porter, Luis Resto, Rikanatti, and DJ Head to the production list, and let us move on with our lives. No need to keep pricking this crap in the butt.

Also, """"DJ Green Lantern"""" should not be under the """"former artist category."""" If you leave him there, you're going to have to add the other Producers/DJs onto said list when and if they leave the label.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The Cook county coroner ruled the cause of my bother Malcolm's death to be bronchopneumonia.  Another brother Brad, who is a physician, spoke to the coroner on the phone, and felt that the coroner had actually not been able to determine the cause of death.  The coroner's report made no mention of cirrhosis or of """"walking pneumonia"""" although I too heard several people comment that they had heard that """"walking pneumonia"""" was the cause.  I suspect that someone mis-heard """"bronchopneumonia"""" as """"walking pneumonia"""".

There are two pieces of evidence that suggest that the cause was carbon monoxide poisoning.  I made the identification of Malcolm's remains at the morgue in Chicago and when I did so I noticed that he had an unusual red skin color.  At the time I was unaware of how this might have arisen but it was so striking that I did comment on it to a number of acquaintances.  I learned later that this skin color is characteristic of carbon monoxide poisoning.  In addition, the person in whose apartment Malcolm was sleeping that night described to me several days later that leaking gas from the space heater in the apartment had been discovered on the morning after Malcolm's death; that the gas company had been called and that the gas had been turned off until the problem could be fixed.  The danger from such gas is due to the possibility of explosion, and to the toxic carbon monoxide it contains.- """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 The main things I disagree about the Haunted Castle post... 

""""No one realized that lives had been lost until later that night, when firefighters searching one of the burnt-out trailers discovered the bodies, thought at first to be mannequins.""""

This is not true. This was reported in our local papers as well. The night of the fire, the media were told almost nothing, and had to go by rumor. I spoke to the fire chief, as well as numerous others on the scene that night. You see, except for the extreme rear portions of the back of the trailers, where the walls were not made of plywood, everything except metal had been disintegrated to ash. The bodies were discovered before dark, as soon as the fire was extinguished, not much later in the night.
The firefighters knew that what they were dealing with were human remains: bones, blood, jewelry and even unburned clothes and wallets inside pockets on those insulated on the bottom of the pile. (I've seen the photos) Additionally, the stench of burned flesh was overpowering, being noticed by patrons exiting the park from the main exit, separated only by a chain link fence from the Haunted Castle trailers. Wax mannequins would have been long-since melted. 
The truth is that the management at first claimed (and might have believed) to firefighters that they had evacuated all patrons from the HC, and there was no reason to close the park. The  castle was isolated, so the fire couldn't spread to other buildings. The fire was out by 7:45, and the park closed at 8:00 p.m. I've never heard of SFGA kicking everybody of the park during an otherwise fairly busy night, with fair weather with a free return pass. An unprecedented decision was made and implemented in 15 minutes. Given this time frame, they clearly found the bodies instantly, and there wasn't time to think that they were """"mannequins"""".    

""""Eight days after the fire, a statement by the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office said a 13-year-old boy had called the police after hearing radio reports that investigators were looking for witnesses. The boy told the police that he had been befriended by a 14-year-old boy at the castle's entrance. He said the older youth, who appeared to be familiar with the castle, offered to guide him through. He said the older youth used a cigarette lighter to find his way down a long corridor that was dark because of a malfunctioning strobe light, and eventually bumped into and ignited a foam-rubber wall pad. The prosecutor exonerated the older youth, who has never been identified, of any criminal wrongdoing.""""
Police knew the identities of both boys by very early the next morning, and interviewed both Saturday May 12th.  The younger boy's parents had called authorities without being prompted by any radio broadcast. The older boy was turned in by his teacher, who had seen him unattended, exit a burning Haunted Castle, and alerted police as soon as he could. This boy set numerous fires. Bumping up against the strobe pad could not have accidentally ignited it. Try to reproduce such a thing. It takes about 30 seconds to set fire to polyurethane foam. It is unclear why the prosecutor didn't go after him.

""""According to news reports of the trial, no such boy was ever found, and no other witness testified to seeing such a boy. Under cross-examination by the defense, the witness denied starting the fire himself.""""

Although its true as it is quote from the article, the identity of the boy was well known to investigators.

I think there should be added also be added mention of the name of the ninth person who lived from the ill-fated group, the legacy of exploitation and disrespect that has been associated with the property, as well as numerous other facts.

Title reign tables, etc
I made tables for the Title reign part, hope that's okay.
 21:17, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)

As the author of the Title History section, I think that the tables are horrible.   I didn't make it that way because it's ugly for anyone that has low screen resolutions.  They are also harder to read in my opinion.  At least, with my presentation of the information, they were easy and straight forward to read.
 02:10, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Finally created an account here, I'm the one who made the tables. Well, I think that my version of the Title History looks better and is better to read. But maybe I'm the only one who thinks that way? I'd like to hear other opinions.
I changed the look of the tables a bit, do they look okay?

I have made two versions of the """"Title History"""" tables now. You can see the other one at Stone Cold Steve Austin. I think the table in Austins article is a bit long. The table in Benoits article might be unfriendly for users with lower resolutions. What do you think which table should be used for the Title Histories for the wrestlers?  12:54, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Do you really need a mini-paragraph for every PPV title event Benoit has?  I mean, in a year, is anyone going to care that Benoit had a US title match against Orlando Jordan at the Great American Bash?

Having a detailed account of every Benoit appearance on SmackDown! is not only tedious, it's unnecessary. -  

Regarding Benoit having """"Super Tombstone Piledriver"""" as a Benoit does regularly, um, no. At one time, a very long time ago, he was doing piledrivers as part of his moveset, but he hasn't done a piledriver, super or otherwise, in many years, dating even well before the ban on dangerous moves in WWE. At this point, anyone who even knows that Benoit did a piledriver at one time should be rewarded for their knowledge of very miniscule trivia. I'm removing it. Someone can consider adding it in as trivia if they like.  

Quotes I WILL MAKE YOU TAP OUT come on he says that!   err

I think Benoit does actually have the record for the longest time in the Royal Rumble. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Rumble#Royal_Rumble_Records  ToneLa

IMO, the Personal Life section needs a little bit of an overhaul.  There's the background as to what led to him and Nancy having an affair (Kevin Sullivan told them to travel and appear in public together to maintain kayfabe, to the point of having Nancy grope Chris in bars) leading to the various """"Kevin Sullivan booked his own divorce"""" comments over the years, Nancy changing her name legally to Nancy Benoit (I'm 99% sure of this, as Dave Meltzer, who's friends with Benoit, exclusive refers to her as """"Nancy Benoit""""), and I'm pretty sure he and Nancy had a second child together.   

At the end of the World Wrestling Entertainment section (where it discusses Benoit's neck injury) it states Chris injured his neck in a match with X-Pac. However, I remember reading a quote by Benoit himself where he stated that he actually injured it in a match with Austin (while taking a stunner) and the superplex in the Triple Threat at KoTR simply injured him further. Can anyone verify this?

""""List of cities by surface area"""" matches that, except that it mentions """"Juneau City and Borough"""".

The pages about those four individual cities today have figures that match, too. Yet, when I posted in this section several days ago, the article on Jacksonville said 1,962.4 square miles.

Jacksonville's own government website says it has 841 square miles, not 874 or 758.

I'm not sure whether some people or governments are rightly or wrongly putting all of a county's land into the city's listed area. I can say that, in the case of Jacksonville, although the governments of the (a) City of Jacksonville and (b) Duval County are unified, there is (or ought to be) separate reckoning of the city's and county's area, because Duval County also contains three other cities (Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, and Neptune Beach), which are not part of the City of Jacksonville (they have their own, separate police departments, for example—even though the Jacksonville Public Library is county-wide).

The government website of the City and Borough of Juneau says it has 2,593.6 square miles of land and 487.6 square miles of water, for a total of 3,081.2 square miles. Neither the total nor the land area there matches what Wikipedia gives.

At the government website of the City and Borough of Sitka, I haven't found the area.

Same for the government website of Anchorage. But it does link to anchorage.net, which says the city has 1,955 square miles—which, like the government figures for Jacksonville and Juneau, doesn't match Wikipedia's figure.

 claims are the most questionable.  

I'm not sure as the the reasons as to why they we're removed but I can tell you that Ink Ball is not found anywhere in the beta release, I'm not sure about the classic start menu and taskbar, i don't see an option for them but I didn't look all that hard   

 Inkball only appears in Tablet Edition windows products.  Is there a tablet addition of the Windows 7 beta?   
 Hmm... I may be wrong there.  The article mentions that it also appeared in Vista Home Edition.  Still, Can't imagine it's very fun with a mouse.   
It does indeed come with Vista Home Premium, not sure about other editions.   
It also comes with Ultimate. But anyway, mentioning it has been removed if the only evidence we have is it's not included in the current beta is an incredibly bad idea. We need a reliable source saying Microsoft has decided to remove it. There could be plenty of reasons why it's not in beta, only one of them is Microsoft has decided to remove it completely

It is true that """"Lots of more modern arts hang without frames."""" But the Signac paintings are 100 years old. And even contemporary art in a Wikipedia article benefits from frames in their presentation to the viewer. Virtually any image benefits from lines echoing the delineation of the (usually rectangular) image. This is somewhat similar to the way scare quotes call attention to a word or phrase. The scare quotes are setting off that word or phrase for special consideration. We have a vested interest in trying to get the reader to take special notice of each image of artwork that we include in an article. If we are going to argue that Wikipedia is not an art gallery or that these thumbnails are hardly impressive in their dimensions and scarceness of detail, then why bother including images of famous paintings at all? I think we all agree that the images are all educational in an art historical kind of way.

127745,ab457bd31bf10b60,"""One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax - user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30, 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants, and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page, user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart.

 Reply to your message about style issues and footnotes/references 

Hi! Just so you know, Template:cite news is the preferred way to cite news sources. Using the template allows us to easily modify references and easily keep all references in the same format. When editing a reference, please do not remove Template:cite news, as you did here. Also, there's no need to name references unless they're used more than once. Thank you.My way of including all references in an article is according to what I've found here and here that's close to the APA style. We are talking about footnotes that are references/citations to sources, right? Was not aware that a specific way to cite only the news, although it's a reference like any other printed source. 

Also, the reference was used twice, with the long version added at the first footnote (for example, such as this reference), and the shortened version used for subsequent mentions of the same citation (for example, such as in this case). If it matters that much for the sake of style and consistency, go ahead and change the format to one for news articles.

On Linda McMahon, you have a long history of editing and edit warring on the page, and probably would have been blocked if Malinaccier hadn't protected the page on September 17; your October 1 and October 2 edits are inadvisable due to your history on that page, but I'm not really concerned with those since the things you reverted are borderline vandalism. Therefore the main motivation for the current block was your final edit to Carl Paladino.    ♦ ♣ ♠ 
I'm not sure I buy two reverts in two days as disruptive edit warring. Moreover, the combination of low speed and non-explicit warnings are concerning. Certainly, the articles in question attract people writing for differing political agendas, but I'm not aware of any specific sanctions/enforcement which apply to these articles at the moment.   
Sir - my """"history of edit warring"""" was basically two years ago.  20 total edits on a page [Linda McMahon]] which another editor has over 800 edits does not seem to me to show anything near an edit war.  So I am surprised to see your rationale is the Carl Paladino page!   is a legitimate edit, and not actionable at all.  is also proper, and a day earlier.  I have a grand total of 28 edits on that page, or an average or just over an edit a day also removing clear vandalism as well).  But you blocked me without any indication of my crime, and were absent for quite a while - leaving me in limbo.  Frankly, 72 hours for a person who has no recent edit war problems seems extreme.   And for this use of block as punishment - I have doubts as to propriety thereof.  Did you block because Ohiostandard kept asserting that I was edit warring?  AFAICT, he never even posted a single diff for his charge. Thank you - now can I be unblocked so I can resume normal editing?  My radiation treatment limits my activities quite a bit.  Oh - look at this sort of """"editor"""" I have had to face at ,  and a favorite example to show the kind of edits I reverted on the article.    
This looks like a bad block, and even worse when I read the explaination from the admin. Is there any """"history/involvement"""" per say with the blocking admin?   
WRT asserting that Ohiostandard 'warned me"""" - he never edited on the Paladino article, nor mentioned it to me. Right now the block is clearly punitive, and I respectfully request it be removed with a note that it was not """"edit war"""" on my part. I do not see the point in having a clear record for nearly two years - and then being blocked for a 1RR because someone """"thinks"""" I must be watched! The only connection I have with Ohiostandard is that he did not like my post about Screwball23.   
Examples of current edits from others  .  And of course the current content of """" Content of the emails in question includes video of dancing African tribesmen under the title """"Obama Inauguration Rehearsal"""", a video titled """"Miss France 2008 Fucking"""", an altered image of President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama dressed as a pimp and a prostitute, an image of a cargo plane landing in an African desert behind a group of panicked men titled """"Run, Niggers, Run!"""" and a video portraying a woman engaged in copulation with a horse.

Edit that Sparked Controversy

There is no consensus for a reverted edit that I made in this article (hereafter the “reverted edit”).  Therefore, I have not changed this article unilaterally back to my previous version, because that would be against consensus.

This reverted edit was reverted by KillerChihuahua (KC) who not only disagreed with it, but also said (in her edit summary) that the edit was disruptive.  I disagree with KC that the edit should have been reverted, for reasons already explained above.  I also disagree with KC that this edit was disruptive, and I will now fully and carefully explain why, for the record. This edit that KC reverted was clearly not redundant to any previous edits made anywhere else at Wikipedia, and thus this edit was not made by me in bad faith as part of any disruptive “edit war”.

This discussion of RCOG’s position on “choice” started at the article on fetal pain, and I moved it here for valid reasons.  At the fetal pain article, KC wrote: """"Please provide a source that this government institution is 'pro-choice' - abortion is legal in the UK, and that the official govt. chartered college are to make that safe is NOT pro choice.""""   I therefore investigated and learned that RCOG is not a government institution, that most of their members live outside the UK, that its governing documents do not specifically limit its activities, that many of its members do not have medical degrees, et cetera.  So, I concluded that the best place to deal with all of this would be here at the article on the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  Here at the RCOG article, I added quite a bit of info,    in addition to RCOG’s abortion stance. When I was at the fetal pain article and decided to move to this RCOG article, I repeatedly said so in the fetal pain discussion.   I did not sneak over here to try to avoid objections at the fetal pain article.

KC has elsewhere cited five diffs that she says prove this controversial edit was virtually the same as several contested assertions I had made previously. Here are KC’s five diffs: (1) in the fetal pain article, (2) in the fetal pain article, (3) in this RCOG article, (4) in this RCOG article, and (5) in this RCOG article.

None of these five previous edits cited by KC is the same (or virtually the same) as the reverted edit that sparked this controversy.  Both KC’s diff (1) and diff (2) show where I inserted a cite to support another editor’s assertion that RCOG is a “pro-choice group”.  KC pointed out very clearly at the fetal pain article that she did not think RCOG was a “pro-choice group” even though she thought RCOG could have a “pro-choice position” on particular issues:

You raise several interesting points.

On the matter of plagiarism in general: Yes, you're right; if a Wikipedia page is remarkably similar to a page elsewhere, that doesn't mean that the WP page plagiarized the other: it could have been the other way around, or something more complex may have happened.

On this page: Its history shows an almost uninterrupted growth to this state, before the trimming started. I haven't examined the growth, but yes, gradual growth (as opposed to sudden jumps in size) suggests that the editorial work went on here. So perhaps I was too hasty.

Here is Graham's page about himself. I now notice that it says at its foot Excerpt from Gallery Press Release, 2008. So it's possible that it copied the press release which itself was a copy of the WP article.

So maybe I have an """"overly critical attitude"""". But if so, it's an overly critical attitude toward the editing, not Graham's work. (I've seen some of his early work from Beyond Caring and think it's very good; I know little about his other work.)

Why the apparent concentration on Japan? First, it's hardly a concentration; it's simply the addition of a sourced fact. And, if you're interested, here's how it came about. Having created Category:Photography in Japan, I populated it. Racking my brain for non-Japanese photographers who'd done a significant amount of work in Japan was a pleasant activity for a commuter trip or three; I also emailed a couple of friends more knowledgable about the matter than I am. Graham's name came up, either to one of them or to me. I was certain that he'd done work in Japan so I put this in  in accordance with WP policy, backing up the assertion with a reliable source. 

This was a contribution of time and energy, though admittedly a tiny one. Graham's work seems to have many admirers. I was hoping and expecting that among themselves they'd rebuild the article. I'd be willing to help with this. While not working on Graham's article, I've been working on articles about other photographers.

So let's turn back the clock to September 2008, before the cuts. Here's a paragraph:

Graham was the first photographer to combine the sensibility of contemporary colour photography with classic British social documentary. In 1981/2 he made A1—The Great North Road, a book of 40 colour photographs taken along the length of the British A1 road, which had a transformative effect on the black and white tradition that had dominated British art photography till that point. This work, along with Graham's later photographs of the 1980s -  the colour images of unemployment offices in Beyond Caring (1984-85), and the sectarian marked landscape of Northern Ireland Troubled Land (1984-86) - were pivotal in reinvigorating and expanding this area of photography, by both broadening it's visual language, and questioning our notions of what such photography could say, be, or look like. Photographers like Martin Parr made the switch to colour soon after, and a new school of British Photography evolved with the subsequent colour work of Richard Billingham, Tom Wood, Paul Seawright, Anna Fox, Nick Waplington, etc.

Let's suppose for a minute that this is legitimate WP text, and not ripped off from somewhere else. Its content is a mixture of the easily verifiable and the arguable. Was he the first photographer to make this combination? Did this one book have a transformative effect? Why """"British art photography"""" (my emphasis)? How were they """"pivotal""""? This stuff would have to be sourced. (Yes, writing for WP is a bitch.)

Backing for some and perhaps even all of this is probably within Williams' text for How We Are and Mellor's for No Such Thing as Society. Do you have either of these?    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Well, thank you so much for your reply. I hoped you would! About six months ago I noticed how badly ballroom dancing in general was being treated on WP, and decided to do something about it. I had been taught dancing by someone who had taken tuition in the latin dances from Pierre & Lavelle, so I knew their names from being a teenager in the 1950s. I wish now I had taken the trouble to meet them, but I didn't. Since I'm something of an expert on Cuban music I decided to start with the group of dancers who started LA dancing in England, from where it has spread all over the world. 

I soon discovered the lack of reliable reference sources was the main problem. I kept seeing references to Pierre, but it was ages before I had enough to put up the page on WP. I still don't have enough for Lavelle. With difficult cases I start a Word file offline. Anything on WP gets copied by bots and plagiarised widely. Even these personal pages.

I've got copies of all the books written about LA dances at that time, including both Dimitri's books and Pierre's book. I don't know where you are, of course, but if you are somewhere in England, we might arrange to meet, and you could have a look at the books. It sounds as though you don't have a copy of his first book.

I've tried to interview all the survivors from that time. So far, I've only found two. I'd certainly like to meet your father if he was willing. He's bound to have lots of things tucked away at the back of his mind which might help us. And I'll answer more fully about myself, but not on WP (for reason given above)

Now I'm going to let you have my e-mail address. If you wish, you could send me an e-mail, which would automatically give me yours. Then, once you know your e-mail has worked, please wipe off my e-address from this page after you've stored it, preferably on a private machine rather than one available for general use (open machines without good security get scanned regularly).

The only """"major controversy"""" is that on this Wikipedia page, the denialists, such as Duesberg and his followers, those whose ramblings are linked out to from this page, and who have had their long-disputed and dismissed theories and misinformation floating around on he web for many years, were being used as the sole source of 'credible' information on the larger controversy around AIDS and poppers  until I happened upon it.  From the first edit I made, I was almost immeditely reversed, and edited.  Within hours of that first contribution, I was being threatened and censored.  Ultimately, I was blocked, charged with violating unknown-to-me 'rules' of Wikipedia, and otherwise censored, and rendered unable to contribute.  And, that, gentlemen, is what I've been complaining about for the past month here on Wikipedia.

It would be much better if the Wikipedians, with their vast experience of computer knowledge, particularly as it relates to being able to master Wikipedia, would stand aside and let those of us who actually have knowledge about the subject of nitrites and poppers make meaningful contributions to this page.

However, I suspect that will not be allowed to happen.  I say this based on my personal experience over the past month here, and based on the news accounts last month on CNN, ABC Nightly News, and elsewhere, which revealed that Wikipedia was being ruined by those who practice the same kind of censorhip and harrassment that I've been subjected to.

Doug you have not read Milton's book yourself. You rely on the review of a single fundamentalist Christian who trained as a physicist. If the article is to be made more neutral, look at these links, funnily enough this first link was written by a creationist but he was more neutral, and please look at all these other links, all third party mostly, theres even a published article from milton himself explaining his position, there is also a review of milton in the independent newspaper, some very negetive, some very positive - To make more neutral both postive and negetive to be included to make an objective view. To make the make neutral i suggest most of these to be included:

 See second page down Review of Milton's Facts of Life

Neo-Darwinism, Is it Time to Reconsider, Richard Milton

Independent book review of Milton's book 

""""Richard Milton's book takes up the evidence of 'adaptive evolution', among others, to wage war on Darwinian theory in general. His interpretation of these particular experiments is that they support Lamarck's long-discredited notion that offspring can inherit the acquired characteristics of their parents.""""

""""For good measure, he throws in a bit of Jung and Sheldrake, along with Fred Hoyle's theory that life originated in outer space: anything that might, from any source or direction, support his own highly opinionated attack.""""

An article written by Milton himself

Here is a negetive review from an evolutionist website of Milton's book

Here is a review of Milton's book which is mixed. This reference is already on the article

Where Did We Come From? An Exploration of Different Theories of Evolution 

Description of Milton's book from a Christian organization """"When a reputable science journalist (and secular evolutionist himself) raises serious doubts about Evolution, then it is time to listen! On subject after subject (fossils, biology, geology, etc.), Richard Milton finally reveals evolutionists' dirty little secret. There is still NO real evidence for Evolution, and the popular dating methods are “scientifically unreliable and seriously flawed.”

You can also see here many books which mention Richard Milton

The fact that some editors beat an argument to death doesn't mean that the issue has gone away.  As long as there's aviation instructors reading this material, the issue still has legs, regardless of whether you think you've heard enough about it. I know it's a delicate subject, but the successful pilots are those who have never crashed a plane, and never become lost. Snook's job was to train such pilots.

He correctly identified the insolation with the time-derivative of the measured ice volume, rather than the ice volume itself, and obtained a spectacular agreement that has solved the 100,000-year problem and other problems below.

Firstly, I am not fixated on, nor am I carrying on a dispute with, Epeefleche, and I certainly have no desire to get into any conflict with them. If you are not prepared to accept that then my posting any further unblock request would be pointless.For what it's worth, my attention was drawn to the article in question by additions made by Epeefleche to several golfer biographies which are on my watchlist. I first posted a message on Epeefleche's talk page explaining the minor changes I had made to those additions to those articles to try and negate any potential for conflict. I also explained the obvious issue I had noticed with the inclusion criteria for that list, before posting on the article talk page. I do not think either of those edits were disruptive or confrontational in any way, and thought I had responded in a reasonable manner to all Epeefleche's comments, while trying to return the focus onto the article. I repeat, I do not wish to engage in any dispute or conflict with Epeefleche or any other contributor and that remains the case. I cannot be any clearer on that.I have acknowledged that I should not have engaged in repeated reverting, and I see how that could potentially inflame things even more than usual in this instance.Yes, my response to Greg L was over the top and I should have done as I usually do – don't click the save page button and just ignore it, but it's too late now. bigissue """,0,0,0,0,0,0

He left Konoha about five years ago, after killing off his whole clan except for Uchiha Sasuke, his little brother. At 17, he was even feared by Orochimaru. He is now currently associated with Akatsuki. Orochimaru had planed to use Itachi's body as a new container, but seeing as Itachi is powerful to such a degree that even Orochimaru fears him (Possibly for the ability to copy every single jutsu he ever obtained with the sharingan) and has stated that Itachi is stronger, it's easy to see why Orochimaru decided to leave Akatsuki and try his luck with Sasuke instead.

Or,
 There have been many debates between fans whether or not Uchiha Itachi is the most powerful shinobi in Naruto, commonly comparing his power to that of the Legendary Sannin.

Hi, Rick Norwood. Funny but I find just the opposite to be true. Badly written edits, i.e. blatant attempts at removing meaning from articles, are mostly done by left-leaning (socialist, modern liberal, etc.) editors. Also, the large majority of editors, and not suprisingly, admins here at the wiki, are socialist and in general left-leaning and are dominating many of the political articles. The meaning of words, the correct charictarization of ideologies, and history itself, is being altered. This article is a prime example of this aricle take-over and the propaganda that is being strongly pushed here. I predict it will be the downfall of Wikipedia. This is sad to me because, what could have been a free and inclusive collaberation of knowledge, has been turned into a giant machine that spits out non-fact, censorship, and well, just plain propagandistic cow flop.

 Comunist """"Agents"""" acting as wikipidia moderators are in fact glorifying comunism. 

I am astonished at the deep diarrhoea of Communism propaganda on articles such as this one on Fidel Castro. This criminal murderous communist (let us understand that no one is a communist only a fool can be a communist). This murderer is being glorified here in this space of wikipedia. 

Let us (at least me), we the ones that don't have the power of moderators, let us uphold reason and above all truth of facts and reality, that this pig by the name of Fidel Castro is not only a communist criminal but is a devil in its own right.

For the crimes that this pig committed and the misery that this pig inflicted in nations and peoples, may the soul of Fidel Castro burn in hell for eternity.

Thank you for your edits. I really am interested in making this article better. What else do you think it's missing? Concerning history, I don't have many sources about the period after the conquest except for the disestablishment in 1797. I've got some things about plague epidemics in the islands during this period, should I include this?   

Thanks for the advice! Yes, I need your help! I have done something already on administration!   

What do you think now on Administration, is it complete?   

Hello!! The article has been improved! I've just included information I found for the Ottoman attacks on Corfu along with other things. I can't find anything on culture; little things and what I've found is not about this period. What do you think of the article now? What more does it need? I've tried to include these information you told me it should unclude, right?

 Personally speaking (of course) I think the British should just give up the ghost, get over their loss of empire, and start living side-by-side with the Irish without feeling the need for such jingoistic terms like """"British Isles"""". After Germany and France, Ireland remains Britain's third largest market in absolute terms, a quite surprising reality which is often overlooked (http://www.eiu.com/index.asp?layout=ib3Article&article;_id=114081196&pubtypeid;=1122462497&country;_id=1460000146&category;_id=775133077&rf;=0).

76643,cd37e4405275dfd2,"Suspected Sockpuppeteer Turns Out to Be a Human
Shocking news break.  It turns out that the person who originally supplied the information in ISM is me!  A real 

person.... not a 'sock puppeteer.'  There are no socks and no puppets.  Just a real person who thought that a 

business was significant enough to warrant a pace on Wikipedia.  Someone who actually understands the business he is 

in, unlike the editors, who have no experience in the field whatsoever.

It turns out- or so we can surmise, that there are lots of people who want to learn about this company.  Oh no!  

This can't be!  It's a business... not an encyclopedic fact!  

But an encyclopedia like Wikipedia should include everything in the world.  otherwise, why does it exist?  

Encyclopedia Britannica and the Oxford Encyclopedia are perfectly sufficient.

Geekish editors have said that listing this company is 'blatant advertising.'  Yet other advertising companies, like 

Modernista, BBDO, DDB, Ogilvy, etc. are all here... blatant advertising.  So, how big does a company have to be to 

be listed on Wiki?  The answer- there is no answer.  It's all up to the whims of people who have no knowledge nor 

experience in business, who call themselves Carbuncle, Smeff, Dongfart, and the rest.  This is surely detrimental to 

the Wiki.

Why do people have such a Pyongyang attitude towards this?  The very idea of limiting what is shown here- censoring 

pure facts arbitrarily- is against the very idea of a global Wiki.  The great big idea is that this site is 

developed by the people of the world, and includes all the things that the published encyclopedias, which have been 

around for hundreds of years, do not or cannot include.

To my mind, and all the other sane, normal people of the world, this is all ridiculous.  

Please cite the arguments of What Wiki is Not and all the rest.  It is a shortcut to thinking.  And clearly there is 

very little thinking here.  

I have had repeated emails from people around the world asking why they cannot find ISM on Wikipedia, and many from 

people who either wanted to add information on the company or were looking for information for research.  Everyone 

was rebuffed.  What kind of person would do this- what kind of person would sit in their little room, hiding 

information from others, and trying to keep reality away at any cost?  Sock Puppets?  Suspicious users?  Legal 

threats?  What kind of cowardly fool says these things without simply engaging in a dialogue with the person who 

originally wrote the article and who always- ALWAYS - asked for editor input and support?

Go on- look at the history.  You will see that editor input was always taken at first, despite the fact that all 

editors here are wholly unqualified to make a decision on this subject.  When asked to explain themselves, no one 

had the nous to do so.  Delicious Carbuncle, BlueBoy, Todd1, Fisher Queen, etc.   All refused to answer for their 

actions.  Cowards and buffoons who have no sense, courage, nor intelligence. 

Anyone who makes an attack on another person, as these 'editors' have, and runs away without facing the person they 

have attacked, is  not deserving of their powers.  

I am now convinced that Wikipedia, despite it's noble origins, is just a place for fools to feel power in a world 

where they are unable to have any in reality.  Go ahead and add your ridiculous little code to me and my site.  You 

have no argument and have no intelligence- if you think you do, face me like a real human- talk, discuss, and the 

rest.  Or be a true Wiki editor and make a stupid, sarcastic comment and run away... hiding... and never respond to 

your comments.
