Now that I checked back for what has been going on in the last ten days while I was away the situation seems hopeful indeed. The bunch of scandalous action inspired by the secretive plottings are still being discusses and widely condemned and I see I see a strong momentum of the community of the Wikipedia editors to finally put a decisive end to the secretive activity at the closed channels followed by the drastically insulting onwiki actions.

Machida returned to his native Brazil to face Phil Davis on August 3, 2013 at UFC 163.[44][45] In a unanimous result, Davis defeated Machida via decision.[46][47] 13 of 13 ufc media outlets scored the bout in favor of Machida.[47] Davis had takedowns near the end of rounds one and two, after neither fighter was able to mount any significant offense. Davis mounted significant offense, as it won him the fight. ESPN scored for Davis. Many UFC shills with hall passes that could be taken away and votes on the ufc rankings, but zero in the way of journalistic credentials of any discernible pedigree in journalism scored the fight 30-27 in favor of Machida.[48] UFC promoter, sport hater, and just bleed advocate, Dana White stated shortly after the fight that he had Machida winning all three rounds,[49] and later told Yahoo! Sports that """"Machida definitely won"""" and """"MMA judging sucks"""".[50] Fightmetric Analysis supports this, showing that Machida outstruck Phil Davis, and neutralized 80% of Davis' takedown attempts, with a significantly higher efficiency rating through all three rounds.[51] ESPN released a similar analysis tracking each fighter's activity in each category, and reporting the 29-28 victory for davis.

Time to start final editing
This article now has a wealth of information, more than enough to cover the subject. I suggest we begin to go through a section at a time and tighten up.
Is all sourced with recognized reliable sources? A scholarly article in a peer reviewed article may be a more appropriate source than a book review in a church magazine. (For instance, maybe the Lutheran Church parish magazine is not the best place to find scholarly information on Martin Luther? I'm Lutheran, so I can poke at myself for fun.)
Is the grammar OK?
How is POV?
Is it covered in other articles and can be removed or moved to the appropriate article?
Evaluate the number and usefulness of some of the citations.
I share some (not all) of Blue Tie's frustrations about the article. Perhaps some fresh editors can read through it for continuity and point out where the article is unclear and where it is too detailed or muddled.
Are our sources balanced? Have we used too many or too few apologetic works?
Have we strayed into Original Research by using so much from the Journal of Discourses? Do any of the established reliable sources cover this same material? Can we quote from them instead? I don't know, but think it should be discussed.

Blue Tie's comments about the background section intro have made me evaluate some of what I wrote. I still need to tighten up and give attributions. I might say """"Historians Brooks and Quinn, as well as others, attribute the Mountain Meadows massacre to a number of factors relating to the conditions in the Utah Territory in 1857."""" Both are mentioned in the ref sections for curious readers to check out. The succeeding subsections should point to the exact citations in those sources.

We need to be evaluating and clarifying, not expanding. (Yes, this is my opinion and it is never humble.) The article is not coming together, it is becoming unwieldy. I came in to help with citations, so I have little ownership for the earlier content. Perhaps my edits have only added to the confusion. I am trying to remain neutral, but it is easy to get sucked in. Are there tools to use for editing? I have been using a sandbox to do major re-writes, then moving it over. Do we want to take a section at a time somewhere else and cuss and discuss it? I have never worked to create a featured article, so I look for guidance in the best way to proceed.

There are basically three of us now editing, and it may be time to step back and let others with a fresh eye work for a while. I know I have miles of articles to go before I sleep. So, I am looking for direction. (and going to work.)  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.
 
You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.
 
Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.
SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen. You are no where near a queen, but certainly are a huge ,filled with trash, dustbin. Pity you, unfortunate daft-LOSER- DUSTBIN.

Fair use rationale for Image:Vivavariety.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Vivavariety.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

As far as I'm aware (owning numerous books on the subject) that is not the scholary consensus at all. The consensus, developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as Roger Griffin, Hamish McDonald, Roger Eatwell and Zeev Sternhell all recongise fascism as a """"Third Way"""" as the references show.

The only dissenters I'm aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible. This of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books. For example, even the foremost scholary expert on Fascism, and a former member of both the Communist Party and then Socialist Party of Italy, Renzo De Felice doesn't try to """"cover up"""" its socialistic origins and third way status.

81296,d972aa4debec021b,"""Hi Paul

Given your previous edits of this article I'm wary of your neutrality here, but here's what I think about this

The 'controversy' section actually has several subsections.   Only the Jones section isn't broken into its own subsection  I guess you don't want to modify those for now.  I looked into the history and at one point it was called """"a controversial person"""" and was much different than its current incarnation.

The Jones subsection is overly long, but I would imagine this particular paragraph has gone through so many iterations that we can't deduce the original intention without looking at older editions.   For instance, the part about Paula buying a house and accruing a tax bill could have evolved beginning with a quote from Coulter calling Jones (her supposed ally) trailer trash.   From there someone may have objected to the quote, so someone else explained its context by saying Jones posed nude.   Then someone didn't want to look POV with regard to Jones so explained her behavior because of a huge tax bill, then someone explained that as a result of buying a house, etc etc.   Most actions in a persons life can be explained, partially, by circumstances out of their control, so explanations like this can go on for eternity.

The references to """"Oh Paula"""" probably developed similarly, with someone demanding citations.   If an evolutionary chipping away of coherency this did occur,  it isn't reasonable to wipe the section altogether.   I saw another reference on the talk page to the Vietnam section being originally quite short but gaining a life of its own as its context was wiped and arguments about it transformed it into something which probably has more weight than it deserves.

I'm sure LimpDaddy would object to this being objective, but the way I see it, the important parts of the Paula Jones section are
- Coulter wanting to """"bring down the president"""", no matter the best interests of her client/advisee 
- Coulter, a supposedly great lawyer, advising Jones to go forward on a case that was ultimately dismissed
- Coulter using Paula Jones then washing her hands of her once the dust settled (calling her """"trailer trash"""")

Additionally, the motives of the various authors are at odds, but reading it, the picture that emerges is of a very two-faced individual.  I'm sure some would say Coulter just learned the truth about Jones upon which she changed her tune, but that doesn't give Coulter nearly enough credit.

Though it doesn't matter for this section, you might see that the """"trailer-park trash"""" comment.   It is not satire or sarcasm to achieve comic effect, it is an honest to goodness insult.

 I agree with User:Man with two legs that the graph is extremely misleading.  See this quote about (or maybe from?) Edward Tufte:
 Before the development of spreadsheet graphing, the most common graphical mistake was the use of artist-drawn 3-D images with the height of 3-D objects representing the magnitude of the data points.  In these charts, both the height and the width of the drawn object increase proportionate to the magnitude of the data points.  The effect is to exaggerate the differences in magnitude as the viewer tends to perceive the area of the figures rather than just the height as representing the magnitude. (Source)
 The image suggests that the Tsar Bomba, which was three or four times more powerful than Castle Bravo, is actually 40 times larger in volume (or ~10x larger in area).  If explosion volume went up by about the cube of the yield (not really accurate, but much closer than this chart) the Tsar Bomba mushroom cloud would be 1.5x taller than Castle Bravo and 15x taller than Hiroshima.  Instead, the diagram shows the CB and TB over a thousand times taller.  

 On this scale, one could conclude that since the Hiroshima bombing's mushroom cloud was about four miles high, the Tsar Bomba explosion (3,000x taller) must be larger than the Earth itself.  98.218.195.90  12:41, 6 July 2010",0,0,0,0,0,0

(I hope this is the right way to reply)
Good question. No, of course, it does bump up the principal. How about this thought experiment: for continual compounding, what if the payment is not made continuously? I only mean this rhetorically. The fact is, the payment period and the compounding period do not need to coincide at all; the compounding period is a convention. I hope I express this properly, and I do not do this on a day to day basis, but my understanding is:
 The compounding per se is on a six month basis, but can be calculated at any time.
 So, if you are late three days (and no grace period, etc), the amount payable is added to principal for this period of time. If you ask the bank (and their systems are up to date), you can determine new principal, which is old principal plus payment amount plus accumulated interest to that day.
 If you pay on the third day, you will have interest payable on the original principal plus the delayed payment for three days at the six-month compound rate (expressed as a fraction of days / six months).
 In fact, this is basically identical to interest on a given sum for x% annual interest for y days. You would pay interest of principal times x% times y/365. It just doesn't get compounded for the interim days (for example, on a daily basis).
 Why six months, etc? I have no idea. That was the convention a long time ago and it has stuck, and I think at one point """"they"""" chose to require banks etc to all quote and calculate on the same basis, rather like an APR.
 The point being any rate/compounding period can be chosen, the calculations are just extra work often dictated by convention/regulation. Hope this is clear. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 What are you talking about? 

Excuse me, I have no idea what you are talking about.  What do you mean by """"stalking""""?  I came across The Intruder and thought I could make it a little better.  I reorganized it, put in headings, added some wikilinks, deleted your signature (unlike blogs, Wikipedia editors don't sign articles), and took out some clear violations of WP:NPOV.  How is this stalking?  I haven't followed you around to any articles you have edited and vandalized them.  I don't recall how I came upon the article, my contributions list show it was just after some vandalism reverts  where I often find articles of interest, whether vandalized or not.

Many editors with blogging background don't realize that article listings for movies, books, theatre, etc. are not reviews.  Such quotes as, """"'The Intruder' contains William Shatner's best and bravest lead role, played to the hilt, and the hilt disappears into Adam Cramer,"""" are perfectly fine in a review, but not in Wikipedia.  You might want to read Wikipedia policy concerning original research.  If you can find similar sentiments in the print media or other such source, then, by all means, add it and reference it.  Don't worry about getting the format correct, put the information in the article and other editors will fix it up to conform to Wikipedia's manual of style.  You might want to look at other articles for movies to get a feel for the format.  Eventually, the """"original research"""" part of your contribution will be deleted.  If not by me, then by another editor.  I've found it better to anticipate that and write my articles accordingly.

As for Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/What Really Happened (2nd nomination), I made my comments and have moved on.  Lots of editors make comments on deletion articles every day.  I have commented on several hundred AfDs (Articles for Deletion).  For the most part, I don't recall what any individual says 5 minutes after I click the save button.  Sorry, but I don't recall your comment, nor whether you are for or against deletion (although, I presume you took the opposite stance from me).  I read enough to get a feel for the arguments, did some research, and came to a decision.  In the past I have pushed delete and the articles were kept.  Other times I pushed for keep and the articles were deleted.  That is the nature of AfD.

I am Barry Slemmings. I was a professional journalist for 30 years finishing as a sub-editor/proof reader before my retirement in 2003. I now work as an unpaid volunteer on Brancaster Beach. I live in Docking and near to Fakenham.

You have queried some changes that I have made on the Brancaster page.
If you check the page history you will find that I am the original author of the whole section entitled 'National Trust and the beach'. There is no 'original research' anywhere on the entire Brancaster page as it is all written from the local knowledge of myself and others who came to it before me. That is the nature of town and village pages on Wiki. The changes I have made to the NT and the Beach section were due to recent changes 'on the ground' and were at the request of my boss to keep it inline with the National Trust's own information policy. My boss knows that I edit the Wiki page and it is highly regarded locally. I would ask you to revert my changes.

On the rest of the Brancaster page I also wrote Geography and Geology and substantially re-wrote Shipwreck on the Beach a couple of years ago. Again most of this is local knowledge and very hard (almost impossible) to 'prove' as original research. As local knowledge I assurre you that it is accurate as otherwise you would have received complaints or someone else would have re-edited my errors. In the UK Wiki is highly regarded for such local knowledge.

The other changes regarding Fakenham and Docking were minor edits and are due to changing information. Towns and villages are not sterile, they change and evolved. I was merely up-dating, as a good sub-editor would. I would again ask you to reconsider reverting to my changes.

Elsewhere - in other subjects - I often make minor edits to correct spelling, punctuation or minor errors. That's that old sub-editor and proof-reader coming out in me. Once a wordsmith, always a wordsmith and I hope that Wiki benefits from your efforts and mine.

Please let me know your thoughts.

We agree that there are human rights that do not appear in any law book, treaty, dictionary, or even a USSC decision. The founders of the US said this, and wrote an expandible constitution.

 GAC review 

This article is off to a good start, but I see some problems with the sourcing, formatting and prose that concerns me.  At this moment the article does not fulfill the GA criteria, but I'm willing to put the nomination on hold in order to allow contributors to work.  Here are some suggestions/comments for improvement:

The references are a mess.  None of them are formatted properly and several of them (IMDb, scifipedia, hunkymalecelebs) are not from reliable sources.  I suggest using citation templates in order to correctly format the links and look for replacement refs for those from disreputable sources.  (habla conmigo) 
Two fansites are linked to in the external links.  Per WP:EL, there should be none.  Also remove the duplicate IMDb link to the awards and nominations page; this is redundant.
:Image:Han2.jpg does not have a fair use rationale.
The use of """"influential"""" in the lead, although sourced, is open to debate.  I would remove it entirely.
More information needs to be given in order for the lead to adhere to WP:LEAD; there is no mention of his early life, music training, family, or cult following.  Nil by Mouth shouldn't be mentioned by itself and more can be said about his film making, as well.
and can be seen singing and playing piano in the 1988 movie Track 29, and tracing over pre-recorded versions of Beethoven's music in Immortal Beloved: Ref?  Also remember to italicize the film name.
The """"Music"""" section is only one sentence long and no date is given.  The biography should follow a chronological timeline.
After graduating from drama school in 1979, Oldman spent almost eight years in theater, winning various awards: such as...?  Ref?
successfully using an American accent: what does """"successfully"""" refer to?  The accent itself?
In October 2007, movie website TheShiznit.co.uk... how is this a notable website/accolade?
Because of its length, I suggest breaking the """"Filmography"""" list into two columns.
Oldman also directed the music video for """"Red Rover"""", a song from Jewish Rap Group Chutzpah's 2nd CD """"Hip Hop Fantasy,"""": the first comma placement (outside of the quotation marks) is correct, the second isn't; there are several of these that need to be fixed throughout the article.
I did not read the prose too closely, but once these issues have been taken care of, I'm willing to give it a second review.  Until then, I'm going to put the nomination on hold.  Please do let me know if you have any questions or comments.  (habla conmigo) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

There's been an amusing tit-for-tat re-edit of the location of Whitgift School as a result of user Samtheboy mistakenly believing that the school is in the county of Surrey. Without wishing to sound like an anorak, this Greater London vs. the 'old' county boundaries around London is a bit of an old chestnut. Significant changes in local government in the 1960s and 70s (the result of the inexorable spread of suburban London) meant that towns like Croydon, Kingston and Bromley in the south were swallowed up by London, becoming the London Borough of Croydon, etc. One old county - Middlesex - disappeared altogether. Confusingly, the Post Office retained the old names, disregarding the new borough locations, and to this day people in places like Thornton Heath believe they live in Surrey - a fact which couldn't be further from the truth. The same is true of south Croydon, which is in the London Borough of Croydon and hence Greater London. The county of Surrey begins further down the road and the local council taxpayers, commercial ratepayers and other residents of south Croydon pay their taxes, have their roads repaired and their refuse collected by the local London borough. I suppose the reaction is: who cares? But if Wikipedia has pretentions to accuracy, we should get these things right.

 Deleted References to GNU C-Graph 

The following is re-posted, here, on advice from D noted at the end of this section.

Long before I wrote the proposed article """"GNU C-Graph"""", I included references under the articles Convolution theorem and Convolution for the benefit of students and their professors teaching and learning about convolution. These references were removed by  and . Notwithstanding my belief that GNU C-Graph meets the WP:Notability criteria,  pointed out """"external links aren't required to be WP notable, just relevant"""".

Most reasonable people would agree that removing the reference to the only software that easily demonstrates the convolution theorem would be a disservice to the public. The text of the references reads:

Under Convolution#External_links:
GNU C-Graph, a free software package for visualizing the convolution theorem, and displaying signals with their spectral plots.

Under Convolution_theorem#Additional_resources:
GNU C-Graph, a free software package for demonstrating the convolution theorem, and displaying signals with their spectral plots.

No doubt some WP:AGF administrator will recognise the educational value and reinstate the references for the benefit of the public.  

Visionat, the places for these discussions are Talk:Convolution theorem and Talk:Convolution, not your own talk page. Those pages are also where you should have suggested the addition of links to the software you have written, bearing in mind WP:COI: to avoid any interpretation that you are promoting your own software, you should suggest the addition of the links on the talk page and allow independent editors (not necessarily administrators) to decide whether the links are an asset to the articles. If you look at WP:COIU, you will see that an editor with a possible conflict of interest may """"make edits where there is clear consensus on the talk page (though it is better to let someone else do it)"""".

I think the answers to these questions are unfortunately a bit muddled.  Initially I was going to say that the Public Relations Officers who wrote those articles may have inserted the term without thinking (or knowing).  However one possibility is that since ISAF is a reaction to the Bonn Agreement, it may be considered peacekeeping with the parties including the fledgling national government and the various quasi-legitimate warlords.  But the Taliban and Al-Qaeda are not parties to any agreement.  To my understanding, without an agreement in place between sides, there is no peacekeeping.  """"Security Assistance"""" (the SA in ISAF) to me is a subset of the military term """"peace support operations"""" (peacekeeping is another subset of peace support operations).  In the end, I think the NATO and ISAF webpages must be authoritative, and I have seen no mention of the term """"peacekeeping"""" on any of the main documents I have looked at.  I don't claim to be an authority, and soldiers (and bureaucrats, and politicians) argue about the meaning of words all the time, but to me 'peacekeeping' has a specific meaning that ISAF does not fit.

Unfortunately politics has interfered in my recent edits on Northern Cyprus. As a Turkish Cypriot I have volunteered my time to improve and expand the article on Northern Cyprus with my sources been taken from websites based in Northern Cyprus. Some of the information I added was changed around and improved in a way so in which it can be understood. If you could compare the information with the original it is quite different with some sections using different wording and such. I was ready to negotiate with Dr.K and was even prepared to alter the section into my own words. But unfortunately it wasn't enough. The dispute initially started with GiorgosY who is now banned from editing. Many attempts to vandalize the page where made by this specific user over the past few weeks. Attempts to delete, blank, and vandalize the page was also made by various other users disagreeing with factual well sourced information which has been taken from archives and books written by professional historians. I would like to state that Dr.K deletion of the sections on Northern Cyprus where politically motivated. As a regular Wikipedia reader and editor I will be very disappointed if information which doesn't suit the specific nationalistic interests of users is deleted. Thank you!

 Understanding how to write Wikipedia articles 

You are obviously a single-purpose account, contributing only to Ashwant Dwivedi. The chances are high that either you are that person, you are related to him or you know him personally. In any event, you are pretty consistently making a mess of things at the article and I'm struggling to clean up the problems that you create. It's not a vendetta against you as a person, though.

There is little doubt in my mind that you would benefit from contributing to a wider range of articles in order to gain exposure to how we actually write things here. There is, for example, no rationale for including every news story that you can find about a person - especially not when they are trivial soundbites or repetitive information - nor is there any need to misrepresent sources by saying he is a """"Pacific Islands Diplomat"""" when, at best, he was a Fijian one. Things like this would be more obvious to you if you were not so constrained by your self-imposed concentration on one article. They would also be more obvious if you actually tried discussing things with other people and listening to what they say. I'm not always right but I am pretty experienced here and, as with anything in life, one key way to learn is to pick up things from those who have done it before.

I'm absolutely fed up with you at the moment, having given you a massive amount of rope over many months. But I'm quite happy to let bygones by bygones if only you can actually demonstrate a willingness to develop your skills here. The article will, in my opinion, be deleted anyway but there is much else here that you could work on in the future if you are prepared to spend a bit of time understanding how Wikipedia works. I rather suspect that we could use more decent contributors for Fiji-related subjects, for example. -   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

As every German muscologist and textbook knows, the point of a 'development section' is *not* various varietites of 'thematic modification'  it is *tonal and harmonic instability* after the stability of the second-subject key and before the restoration of the tonic. Has no-one actually bothered to listen to what does   and doesn't  happen in the included extract...?!? IT'S MODULATORY, AND THAT'S ALL. 

This article is too deeply confused to be rescued. It should just be deleted. Hell, it doesn't have a single worthwhile source... or any idea about the original German terminology...  Pathetic...

Guilt by innuendo?

Let us say that I establish an organization (you can figure out why) whose sole purpose is to register and treat victims of physical abuse by you, as reported by your neighbors and family.

I'm archiving this section because the pettiness simply is non-productive.  Let's try to figure out something that we can do constructively with these articles.  An A7 CSD was clearly wrong, but let's face it, most of these articles deserve to die.  The question is how to handle this constructively, which is what is going on above.  Let's stop quibbling over the rules and work towards getting something constructive done.-' NO! I'm Spartacus! 

Steve, I can tell you one way which will not work for the articlesand that is to do as you have done, and deleted some of them as G4, as if the AfD had closed the way you wanted it, not as keep. And the many you deleted (as did Orderinchaos) as dg-a7, non-notable person, in total defiance of WP:CSDA7.    The closer told you the right waynominate for deletion the ones you want to, individually.   I've asked you both on your talk page to restore them.  Sarah, can you explain to them about the inadvisability of outright   defiance of Wikipedia policy?  After we get this cleanup up, I'll talk a little about proper merging/redirect. As you may guess, I shall almost certainly to revert any redirects or merges except with consensus for each article. That does not mean I might not agree to some , most, or even all of them if procedure is followed properly. '  
I would suggest that threatening the community to edit war against it when it is trying to find a solution to a problem and work through differing and even opposing points of view to mutual satisfaction, is neither a wise nor an advisable course of action. Your behaviour at the past AfD is already under scrutiny - you openly defied policy in ways I have never actually seen from an admin who managed to keep his bit thereafter. VirtualSteve and myself closed articles which had been recreated against consensus, the recent AfD offered no opinion on any individual article and was a reaction to the mass nom (which, while I supported, I did not initiate nor did I think it was the absolute best way to resolve the situation - though as it has gotten the right people talking to each other, may yet result in progress). A bit of cooperation rather than snarky threats to disrupt and offline abuse of contributors would go a long way from you, DGG. Orderinchaos 
No, but I can explain to you about the inadvisability of outright defiance of Wikipedia's policy on wheel and edit warring. The edit war policy states """"Edit warring is the confrontational, combative, non-productive use of editing and reverting to try to win, manipulate, or stall a content dispute."""" Strangely enough that sounds an awful lot like what you're threatening to do. You've certainly got a check on the """"confrontational"""", """"combative"""" and """"non-productive"""" criteria. Redirecting and merging are editorial decisions which can be performed in the usual manner and the threat to revert attempts to do so is truly stunning. As is the arrogance implicit in the statement that you'll return to lecture us poor shmoes on how to do merges and redirects the """"proper"""" way. 8| You don't have any more authority here than any one of us and your behaviour regarding this subject has been outrageous and disruptive. I haven't had anything to do with you before this so I don't know if this is an aberration or if it is how you usually behave and approach dealing with other editors and fellow admins but if it is, as emails I've received since my email to the mailing list would suggest, there are serious concerns about your behaviour that will need to be addressed. As a co- (by 5?!) Vice President of the Wikimedia NY sub-chapter you really ought to be setting a far better example and not acting like an arrogant bully-boy, standing over people who are discussing ways to resolve this, and threatening to revert good faith attempts to clean up a mess, which even you yourself have said needs to be cleaned up. You really should know better and I'm appalled by your behaviour. Sarah 
I've also received some interesting info in recent days about unrelated disputes, and have made the relevant authorities aware. The odd bit is that there isn't even a dispute here as such between the different active, editing parties here - merely differing positions on notability which can actually be negotiated. The editors who come to this as fans have said they are - 1. willing to work with us; 2. willing to help with content. In return, we as the editors who come to this from the policy issues side have said we are - 1. willing to work with them; 2. willing to help with content.

But I am, however, still just curious about it. These are my questions:

1. With other cables I've seen, the MALE end is the one where there is a center pin or set of pins plugging into a jack where there's a receiving hole in the center, whether or not there's also a female-like sheathe of some kind around the connector pins. For examples: coaxial cables (F, RCA, etc.), DIN cables (S-video, some older rounded computer cable plugs, etc.), """"D"""" plugs, and DVI. Of course there would be others, too. Okay, so the one with the pins has been male, while the one that the pins plug into is female, even if the one with the holes fits into an outer casing that the one with the pins is in.

Well, that's been true up until HDMI came out, apparently. Look at HDMI and what the industry is calling its """"female"""" and """"male"""" ends. They're calling the end with the pin row the female end, and the end with the slot that the row of pins plugs into the """"male"""" end (and keep in mind that the end with the bar of pins is also the end with a female-like casing around it, just as I pointed out above, yet those above like that are still MALE; yes, the slotted end of HDMI sort-of plugs into the sheathed-like end, but then so do several of those others I mentioned above which were always called FEmale, because what really counts has been the PINS, not the edges. So why isn't HDMI's PIN end the one called MALE like the others?

2. Who is it in the industry that first insisted that this slotted end of HDMI should be called backwards of other kinds of plugs, the """"male"""" end, and that the end with the pins in the middle should be called backwards of other connectors, the """"female"""" end? Who from the industry started that and sort-of """"dictated"""" to encyclopedias, etc. that this is """"how it's supposed to be,"""" and what made them the supposed """"authority""""?

39359,69082355e78359b1,"Network proxies are used for a number of reasons. There is the type that many organizations use to limit what their employees (or students, etc.) have access to, which is the reason you and your coworkers do not have access to Facebook or Gmail. They can also speed up access to websites and reduce the amount of internet traffic by caching or storing copies of pages that are frequently accessed. Normally, the proxy software is configured so that only users inside the network have access to it. In this case, however, it is misconfigured so that everyone inside and outside the network can access it. The effect is that anyone, anywhere in the world, can appear to be a user on your company's network. People often access this type or proxy for privacy reasons, but they are most often used as a gateway to send spam, to launch network attacks, to facilitate viruses and trojan horse attacks, and, sadly, to vandalize Wikipedia articles, which is the reason we automatically block them.

But to get back to your questions: I have no way of knowing when the IP address began acting as an open proxy, but it appears that it was detected and blocked by an automated process here on October 22, 2011. And, no, most organizations do not employ open proxies due to the security concerns I mentioned above. It appears that the IP address has not been included in any anti-spam blacklists yet, but if you run a Google search for it, you will see that there are some indications of trouble. Most network admins would be very glad to hear about this sort of issue before the IP address appears on blacklists gets blocked by their own or other internet providers.

 Re: Ridiculous bands listed as supergroups 
I completely agree with this sentiment. Theres something wrong when there are 10+ groups listed as supergroups from 2005-2006. A band that forms with members that have been in previous bands does not automatically make it a supergroup. The last few bands listed dont belong in this article.


 I don't think it should matter whether the previous bands are household names, but I DO think they should be removed from the article if they weren't formed with promotion from previous bands. For example, several of the 2000s bands are promoted as such: Velvet Revolver was promoted as """"Stone Temple Pilots meets Guns n' Roses"""", Audioslave was promoted as """"Soundgarden meets RATM"""", Army of Anyone is being promoted as """"Filter meets STP"""", etc. In other words, bands with promotion like The Raconteurs being """"Jack White with a band"""" aren't supergroups, because they're widely known as Jack White's side project, and NOT """"White Stripes meets The Greenhornes"""".

ChrisB???
Who elected ChrisB as """"god"""" of the Supergroup article?  I thought Wikipedia was about discussion and reaching consesus (sorry about the spelling there).    

I've moved this here from Supergroup (music) - if there is another meaning of the word, I think somebody should write about it before we add parentheses to things. It's easy enough to move things back later. 

Whatever it is, it's pretty thin soup, if you'll pardon the pun.  I'd give you CSNY, ELP, Travelling Wilburys, and the Bloomfield-Kooper-Stills session, but the rest are pretty much bands (some great maybe, never even heard of Sky), that sold a lot of records.  

 Ridiculous Bands listed as Supergroups 
It seems that people are using this page to promote their own bands, or own obscure tastes, which they find """"super."""" I agree with the aforementioned, and will weed out some of the lesser-known acts, and those featuring lesser-known musicians. Feel free to restore this page, if you believe that I'm wrong. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) 23:02, December 14, 2004  (UTC)

I believe the text at the top of the page does a pretty good job of explaining the definition (or lack thereof) of the term, and its use as hype.  I think a better tactic than removing information entirely would be to move the """"ridiculous"""" groups, or those who are termed supergroups merely because of membership, not achievement, to a separate heading.  Keep """"Renowned Supergroups"""" at the top, if you like, while putting in an objective criteria for membership in this group (number of albums sold, perhaps?).  Add another heading or two for """"Other Supergroups""""; maybe even """"Failed Supergroups"""", and move the rest of the entries on the list there.

I sympathise with your desire to tidy this up, but removing information completely is seldom the answer.  \talk 23:31, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

There, I've broken it up with the groups you left on the page as """"renowned""""  expect others to move bands in and out of that section.   I'm not entirely happy with the result; I think perhaps a better structure would be to divide the list by decade  I think it might provide a clearer view of which groups have stood the test of time.  What do you think?  \talk 00:07, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)

If none of the members have pages in Wikipedia (I'm looking at you, Misery Index), then it probably isn't a supergroup.

Wow. When I last modified this page, it wasn't absurd. The average person when they end a relationship or employment will go on and find another relationship or job.

Fair use rationale for Image:Catania1946.jpg

This file may be deleted.
Thanks for uploading Image:Catania1946.jpg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. When you use a generic fair use tag such as {{fair use}} or {{fair use in|article name}}, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

65217,ae7e01fa4c952931,""":::: sprot only blocks IP (and brand new) addresses from editing - it does not stop anyone from reading, nor does it stop anyone who wants to contribute to create an account with an unidentifiable and untraceable name (i.e., don't give your email address) and contribute.  The edits made by multiple IP addresses on this page, as you know,  have been (not always but  by and large) at best unhelpful but much more often downright offensive and I see absolutely no reason why that should be allowed to continue.  Again, you know I am not talking about the juvenile HI MOMs - they are also annoying, but that is not what plagues this page.  We are plagued by targeted vandalism - changing """"Obama"""" to """"Osama"""", for example, and the regular changing of text that has hidden text clearly requesting that it not be changed right there, plus blatant POV pushing, trolling, etc.  Classic case for permanent sprot. The result, when sprot is in place, is the ability to conscientiously edit and improve the article (which has a changing base of facts so needs constant attention).  But rather than being able to easily evaluate substantive changes that responsible editors make, we are bogged down in having to go through screen after screen of pure and often vicious vandalism. For what positive reason, may I ask?

IP edits also can be used, I suppose, by regular editors who don't want to reveal that they are making sub rosa changes, but I would hope that is not going on here.  

And IP addresses have quite rarely reverted vandalism here - in fact I just looked at the last 500 edits and didn't see a single case of an IP address reverting vandalism. Maybe I missed one, but that claim was not really reflective of what goes on on this page - it is a very small group of actual editors who do the vast majority of the reverting.  

Your comment above about there being only one vandalism on Dec 21 was just one day after sprot was lifted the last time. I said then that I hoped to be wrong, but predicted that vandalism would be back up and it is.  That's why I requested extended protection.

If what  you were unhappy about is the tag itself, I also thought all along that we should have {{sprotect2}} and had thought to change it last time but the block was lifted before I had a chance to.   I have changed it to that less obtrusive tag.  The question of the duration  of the lock is what I am interested in. Two-three weeks is much better than what we had a few weeks ago, and may coincide with any announcement that Senator Obama makes which is also good timing for sprot, but  I'd like to understand why you would want it not to be an extended one, because I can't make any sense out of your position on this, as a person (you, I mean) who clearly is interested in having this remain a high quality page, as evidenced by the excellent work you do here, and the fact that this page has been by far your main area of Wikipedia editing.    | talk

Have it as another tab on the tabs already on GA pages
Specifically go out to recruit people, either dropping personal notes at talk pages, wikiprojects and the signpost (maybe even a watchlist header if you can swing it)
Advertise it as purely to get inexperienced editors reviewing. Make it clear that there will be help right the way through the process and they can't really make too much of a mess.
See if you can get some regulars who are willing to have their articles reviewed by these new reviewers. That should help alleviate any biting issues. The bonus for the regulars is that they will get there articles reviewed faster.
I would not treat this as a way to clear the backlog, but to get those reviewers who have considered reviewing, but were a little unsure whether they could.

Sorry to bug you, but I think you resolved the dispute with Coolceasar on the UC Hastings page very nicely.  I now note Coolceasar has been making biased (who knows why) assertions against Hastings on the general UC page, editing the page so the Hastings is not considered a UC but only an affiliated institution.

lol. Regardless of intent or accident - I actually wish that GoingBatty would listen to my request and avoid pages that I'm working on. GoingBatty was (and still is) not interested in  Brazilian Hip Hop unless he's a secret gangster rapper. Maybe after a hard day in the hood with his scout charges this scoutmaster relaxes by expressing himself through rap. Anyway I'm bored by him and a whole bunch of other editors - all of whom seem to be here either as incognito moralists, conservatives, protectors of childhood, nationalists, etc. I imagine that many of the neo-nazi groups are here also. Its my experience of right-wingers that on the whole they don't want you to know what they are up too. I remember an arts center open mic night which I was attending being infiltrated by five or six or them. It was a surreal situation because none of them were actually musicians - they pretended to be comedians which allowed them the right to attend and perform. The woman who ran the night and who had no idea of how the BNP (British National Party) worked and put one of them in charge. I emailed the arts center due to the fact that I knew some of the people who ran the open mic nights (including the woman who had been put in overall charge and had made the decision to put him in charge) and got an email back saying the open mic nights were for everyone regardless of their political views. A week or two later I received another email saying that the arts center had decided to separate the comedy from the music by having separate nights for both. I'm  not too sure why but I do know that at one of the open mic nights the leader of this small BNP cell had been put in charge and after one of the singers had finished (she was colored) he said something that was really strange. I can't say what because people who were there may be reading this but it was racist. About a hundred people witnessed and heard what he said and everyone just sat silently in shock not knowing how to react - after all he was in charge. Now that is power. When you can persuade others that your intent is one thing and then position yourself to impose your will or views upon those who believe your original lie - well that is political power. Its not even a right wing thing since many left wing leaders have used to same ploy. It is the nature of a dogmatic personality who is seeking power to follow such a course when faced with opposition to their dogma. Here's what happened after the torrent scene released the membership list of the BNP and I spotted that one of them was a town planning consultant employed by my local council. I sent an email to my council of course. Evidently my council believe that hiring a BNP member as a town planning consultant for one of the most highly diverse ethnic towns in England was fine because his racist views shouldn't affect his ability to provide good advice. lol

Constance Cumbey Update on March 5, 2005 at 10:44 p.m., E.S.T.

Squeakbox's allegations about Nazism and editing a Rastafarian page (to the best of my recollection I have never been to such a page  my knowledge about Squeakbox's Rastafarian sympathies came from his own Wikipedia page)are nothing short of libelous and outrageous.  Obviously he has never read my work.  Most likely he is unfamiliar with the extremely readable and scholarly books of James Webb on occultism, including Nazi permutations of same.  Nazism was clearly based on occultism  evident in every respect from the Thule Society and Theosophical Society roots to the swastika itself.  Hitler did not take his notions from a vaccuum  his notions of """"cleansing actions"""", """"master races"""" and """"aryanism"""" were standard fare in all occult reading  both of Rosicrucians and Theosophists.  As far as left hand swastikas and right hand swastikas are concerned, there are ample books (many of which are in my personal library) showing that it was used interchangeably both ways in both occult and Indian cultures.  The Jews were singled out for hatred in most such literature and still are in the books published by Lucis Trust / Lucis Publishing Company.  Just look at the indexes (and you can do free internet searches):  """"Judaism:  evils of""""; """"Judaism, need for dissolution of"""".  I have BATTLED Nazism and racism all of my life, starting at age 4 when I told an aunt, """"that man's not bad because he wants to move in your neighborhood.  You're bad because you want to move out just because he's moving in . . .""""  Squeakbox owes me an apology.  He confesses he flunked logic.  He also confesses to a closed head injury with a machete type instrument.  For that, I will give him in good Christian style, a charitable interpretation and hope to think that these are his honest interpretations.  Read the New Age books CAREFULLY and not in an altered state  you will find that they are not all peace, light love.  And people who come against them are not """"Nazis""""  the kernel of Nazism is the occultism which in its essence spells doom to all who are not blonde, blue-eyed pagans in its ultimate world view.  I have many a New Age book from the early 1980s in my vast personal collection which tells Orientals, Africans, etc., that they should be practicing celibacy as their races are destined to die out anyway.  As regards Solana, he is smart enough to see the Club of Rome agenda for what it clearly is  a global population reduction and occult indoctrination program.

 Summary by 89.101.221.42  

The issue is a recurring one. Proponents wanted:
 Ireland → Ireland (island) (or a variation)
 Republic of Ireland → Ireland (state) (or a variation)
 Ireland (disambiguation) → Ireland (or a variation)

Several different polls were opened simultaneously on (old page names):
 Ireland
 Ireland (disambiguation)
 Ireland disambiguation task force

A related poll had been run exactly one month earlier at (old page name):
 Republic of Ireland

And one month before then again also at (old page name):
 Republic of Ireland (archive)

Participation at the Ireland page was widest and consensus was against the move. Participation on two (recent) polls at the Republic of Ireland page also had wide participation and fell heavily against the move (both were closed). Participation at the disambiguation and task force pages were limited, but consensus in those polls came down (weakly) in favour of the move.

On this occasion the closing admin was:
 

Initially, Tariqabjotu performed the move request in error - having only seen the request at the task force page. When this was brought to his attention, he posted a response on this talk page. His decision was to maintain the move against consensus as consensus had arrived at """"an illogical conclusion"""" (which he linked to Wikipedia:Polling is not a substitute for discussion). Later, he would comment that he had not read the discussions because, """"There's so much stuff to wade through..."""".

Issues believed to be at play:
 Forum shopping
 Vote stacking
 Consensus
 Polling is not a substitute for discussion

(Some) issues at play during the discussion:
 Disambiguation: Is there a primary topic?
 Naming convetions: Controversial names

Miscibility in solvents?
1) In addition H(1/n)2, where n is an integer > 1, representing the fractional state of a given hydrino pairing, it forms more complex compounds such as hydrino hydride crystals.
2) Hydrinos being a gas, there is no specific density it may have. Detecting the boiling point and melting point of hydrinos requires cyrogenic cooling or exotic pressures. The formation of hydrinos results in increased temperatures. It is unlikely that BLP will place measurement of boiling points and melting points ahead of understanding the catalytic processes which may form hydrinos in the first place.
3) High energy radiation
4) Miscibility is a property that occurs between two or more substances. Hydrinos, being a gas with an effective cross-section much less than ordinary than hydrogen, would be highly immiscible with most substances due to a much greater ease in passing through matter, in such a manner that it will easily escape into space.

-TABSaving 300 000 lives against the odds, the pressure and the sheer logic, if one is criminally antisemitic through and through, is a fact sir. 
-TABDismantling the Iron Guard, a declared antisemitic and pro-german organization, is another paradox
-TABMarying a Jewish lady as an antisemit, doesn’t make sense
-TABAllowing the Jewish community to have official representatives, to befriend at least one of them, the lider of that community and to lend him an attentive ear and to let him convince you to change some of the previously issued orders and laws, does not, again, fit into an antisemitic profile. 
-TABAllowing some of the deported Jews in Transnistria to be repatriated, is not, again, an act of an atisemite. (It is another unprecedented act; can you quote one single similar occurrence in an Europe under the german boot?)

Please explain this. My request is NOT rethorical. I do agree on your superior erudition in the matter, for all I know, you might be a historian, whereas I am just interested in history. And PLEASE don’t refer me to other books, reports, authors. Just give me your own opinion on the points above. Not your opinion that they do not matter, but how do you explain them? I accept your patronizing unpleasant as it may be, if you’ll just explain. 

And try to see my point: I DO accept the possibility of being wrong. I try to stay as objective as I can, but till now, I heard rather unilateral accusations, rather than specific proofs and facts. That’s the diference between us, when confronted with discrepancies, you sir seem to deliberately ignore them, because the authors you read do so; me, I start my own research. I have spoken personally to at least 50 people, who lived through those terrible times, not Jewish, unfortunately, but certainly not antisemitic. (It’s not much, but at least I did it; what’s YOUR personal research ?) They are spread over all major Romanian regions, my witnesses, covering many different trades. Not one, mind you, ever heard, much less witnessed, any antisemitic violence ORDERED BY ANTONESCU or his government on Romania – old territory. Please quote contrary evidence, first hand if possible. I confess, I couldn’t find Jewish witnesses, all my Jewish friends and aquaintances are too young for that, but I’m still looking. 

And excuse me, the accusation of “incomplete quoting” the Wiesel repport is ludicrous. Would you want me to quote the full text ? My point was that even in a report that I consider unilateral and biased (like a trial with prosecutors only and without defenders), important facts like apparently inexplicable acts of mercy and a definite orriginal Jewish policy, totally opposed to that of Germany, at a time when Germany was still all powerfull, could not be remained unnoticed. The Wiesel Commission itself, sir, could not ignore those facts; how can you ? 

The Wiesel Report allowed such colossal mistakes as blaming a whole state, a whole nation, I remember of having read the phrase “the crimes committed by Antonescu and the Romanian nation against Jews”. You never blame a whole nation, a whole population. 

 The blame sir, is INDIVIDUAL, as Frederic Forsythe says. And so is the salvation. 

An intelligent man knows that when you deal with great numbers, you have to apply statistics, over-generalization is one of the  most unforgivable acts. And such a phrase lies in the same report in which there are mentioned pro-Jewish acts, both from government level and from individuals, only to underline that they don’t count. And you want me to take such a report as gospel truth, a model of impartiality and justice ?

MR MIRCION, kindly, get a grip on yourself. To state that Antonescu is “my hero” proves you didn’t even tried to read what I wrote; if so, how and what are you criticizing ? 

I repeat, to be sure Antonescu was involved in war crimes. Commited in war zones. He was not involved in crimes against humanity, in cold-blood premeditated murder, based on an ethnic cleansing policy, on the contrary, he tried, and partially succeeded to stop it, against considerable political pressure and certainly against the major antisemitic trend in a Germany dominated Europe. He is to be condemned, of course, but NOT for the wrong reasons. At the time of the reckoning, both good and bad deeds should be put in the balance. Romanians, sir, have the right to criticize, accuse, and condemn Antonescu. Not the Jewish people from Romania-old kingdom, since Antonescu saved 300 000 of them while sending almost half a million of his own people to their death. 

To be sure, this is just my opinion, but it’s based on facts.

There are massive corrections to be made, but, as Ubikwit says, one simply doesn't have the time (at least for now), except to note that the litigants who do edit those pages, can't see the obvious (citing outdated sources like Fenellosa et al. from a century back,etc. I gave details a year ago why none of them are reliable, and suggested how to fix the sourcing: almost nothing done, and my edits are invariably to replace bad edits by giving several good sources, which, however anyone could do, if they had the foggiest idea of what Japanese scholarship knows).

Fastfission, I welcome your thoughts on the article and examples. In defense, here is some reply to the most telling point (and heart of the method) The """"predictions"""" section puts the horse before the cart: Watson had already seen the B-form photograph before they thought of proposing the double helix. In Watson's Double Helix memoir, he clearly states that he and Crick had already worked out the mathematics of the Fourier transform of a Helix as an X-shape. They had come upon it with the TMV (tobacco mosaic virus) and had already deduced TMV had a spiral shape. At the time of discovery (of structure of DNA) they did not know the orientation of the bases (inside or outside the helix) which Watson deduced by his concrete modelling of the nucleotide pairs. The discovery (of structure of DNA) came after, at least according to Watson's memoir. And Watson is still alive to clarify this for us. It is a golden opportunity for someone to ask and write down so that we can cite. But the article clearly states that scientific method is not linear, as you have well put. It is a horse-race between the steps, some of which can then be linearized after the moment of discovery, for publication. I do not mind the adjective lousy; in Feynman's words English is a lousy language, yet we somehow manage to communicate with it, and those of us who are prisoners of the tongue even attempt to think with it as well.

Further, in light of the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2001 in Alexander v.

Thank you for the quick replies! My original thoughts were that it's painfully obvious to any reader that the UK is a country, and that this does not need pointing out  an equivalent example:

""""The United States is a country consisting of fifty states and a federal district.""""
can be reduced, without loss of clarity, to
""""The United States consists of fifty states and a federal district.""""

But very well  I can see that it's been decided to emphasize the UK's status as a country. Fair enough.

GoodDay, Jamesinderbyshire:  You're both very right, of course, but I think there's a chance we could preserve these subtle complexities AND use clear language *at the same time*. Perhaps there is a synonym for country that we can use that would eliminate this awkward wording altogether? I noticed that the """"Four countries of the United Kingdom"""" article uses the term """"sovereign state"""". Would the following work?

""""It is a sovereign state consisting of four countries: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.""""

Alarics: I realize the issue has been discussed before, but I feel that the issue has often been tackled from a political perspective - with pro-devolution/independence editors wanting to de-emphasize UK's status as a unitary state and with nationalists wanting to do the opposite.

I am a Canadian reader, without a lot of knowledge about UK politics or how the country operates. I am approaching this issue purely from a writing/editing perspective. I am simply trying to make this article as *clear and concise* as possible, without losing all the subtle complexities and compromises that various editors have negotiated into the article. I'm certainly not trying to set any new conventions, and I certainly don't want to set off any edit wars.

116059,6c9216047d7f6301,"""::The purpose of this discussion on the proposed intervening section is to illuminate the controversial conclusions and impression that readers took away from the story, because they conflated the reported claims of the DI as described in the story with independently verifiable facts.  The analysis by  Skip Evans illustrates this confusion and provides a reliable source that the claims of the DI are not necessarily valid.  That's one way to establish the controversial nature of stories about the DI which contrast the published claims of the DI to published remarks by signatories like Salthe and Davidson ridiculing the DI's interpretation.

If you want a reliable source that the article by Chang is controversial in its own right, on multiple points, you can take a look at the article's Ask Science Q&A; page on the NYT wherein Chang responds to commentary and criticisms of his piece, and admits that parts of it are slanted toward highlighting the anti-evolution signers and not the pro-evolution ones.  Chang says, """"This article focused on Discovery's petition and thus I did not interview evolution supporters.""""

Elsewhere, you have good evidence that there are evolution supporters among the 103 initial and subsequent signers, notably including Bob Davidson, whose story came to light and is featured in the main Wikipedia entry on the Darwin Dissent Controversy.

This intentional snubbing of evolution-supporters among those interviewed by Chang for comments misleads readers about the statistical mix of those who signed the petition, giving some people the impression (per the desires of the DI) that all signers are variously """"anti-evolution"""" or """"Darwin dissenters.""""  The contemporaneous analysis by Skip Evans reinforces that element of the controversy.

When one realizes that Chang focused the story on the anti-evolution signers (many of whom joined after DI went public, and when one observes that Chang fails to solicit a quote from Picard (even though he mentions her name), one is left wondering which side of the fence she (and others of the 103) reside on.  The purpose of all this is to cast doubt on the unverified presumption (suggested by the existing section which I am forbidden from touching) that Picard belongs to the anti-evolution dissenters.  In other words, I am saying that some of the Wikipedia editors evidently fell into the trap which the DI set, luring readers into believing that all 103 scientists adhered to DI's dubious characterization of them.  

The length of the intervening piece needs to be longer than the section it precedes, because the current section adopts without proof the thesis that Picard is among those belonging to the anti-evolution dissenters.  The proposed intervening section is designed to examine the evidence for the unproven thesis adopted in the existing section and determine whether the evidence for it is credible or conclusive.  As you well know, a proof is typically longer than the theorem.  What's in the proposed intervening section is an examination of the omitted proof, in which the outcome appears to be that the missing proof does not seem to exist, and in fact there is good evidence at hand that the dubious thesis adopted by the existing section is simply false (and therefore unprovable).  If it is false, then it is also potentially libelous. Therefore, establishing the truth or falsehood of the thesis is crucial in order to protect Wikipedia from inadvertently publishing false and defamatory material that slipped through the filters intended to examine the evidence with a keenly skeptical eye.

What any Wikipedia editor happens to know for a fact about the status of the petition in the intervening years is not evidence that anyone whose name appeared in nationally printed ads back in 2001 had the slightest inkling of what the DI was up to in the meantime.  Perhaps Wikipedia editors found this out by doing painstaking research on the DI.  Stanley N. Salthe said in 2006 in the Times article we are examining that he had never heard of the DI.  That's well-sourced evidence that some of those who signed had no clue that the DI even existed, let alone was maintaining a growing list of names.  Therefore one cannot draw any verifiable conclusions about what most of the 103 original signers knew of the DI prior to the 2006 Times story.  

One of the reasons the story is controversial is because it fails to point out that the DI had reprised and evolved a 2001 petition that predated any of the disputed assertions regarding its inherent meaning or its re-interpretion as a testimonial in favor of DI's political agenda.

The two sources which establish the controversial nature of the story are the above mentioned [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/0",0,0,0,0,0,0

Naomi Oreskes claims to have analysed 928 abstracts she found listed on the ISI Web of Knowledge database (1993 – 2003) using the keywords """"global climate change."""" However, this claim is incorrect: while the ISI database includes a total of 929 documents for the period in question, it lists only 905 abstracts. It is thus impossible that Oreskes analysed 928 abstracts.

 

In my original critique, I used the same ISI database and the same key words as Oreskes but used all documents listed therein. While Oreskes did not specify the method she applied in her study, she later confirmed that she had limited her search to “articles”, while I included “all document types” in my initial assessment. This difference appears to explain the discrepancy between the “928” abstracts Oreskes claims to have analysed and the 1117 documents I found and considered, although her figures don’t add up, one way or another.

 

Some commentators have argued that these differences undermine my main criticism while they validate Oreskes' claim. However, as I have stressed repeatedly, Oreskes entire argument is flawed as the whole ISI data set includes just 13 abstracts (less than 2%) that explicitly endorse what she has called the 'consensus view.'

 

In fact, the vast majority of abstracts do not mention anthropogenic climate change.

 

I have posted all documents and abstracts listed in the ISI database under the key words “global climate change” (for the period 1993 – 2003) below, arranged by year. Check for yourself! Make sure you differentiate between implicit and explicit endorsement of the IPCC consensus (“[M]ost of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations."""")

3. Behavior of ABB during the attack, hints at Immunity, not Rage or Hate.

4. Social exclusion and brainwashing by agents close to ABB - denial of any employment, or opportunity, or correction, or sanitation of ABB in spite of previous crimes.
It is a well known fact that Agents in Norge subscribe to """"Voice Transmission"""" - implanting ideas in other minds like a radio.

5. An Almost Impossible explanation for the Genocide - Islamophobia - killing natives (children) has nothing to do with it, unless it is a Fear Tactic with supposedly greater meaning.

This does indicate an extremely feudal and ancient societal structure prevalent in Norge.

The Agency is completely confident of the above claims and will back it to death.

The investigation shall continue. 

A life is precious.

This makes the article NPOV.  I am sure that it may seem that Poles are dealt many criticisms about Anti-Semitism, but that is no different elsewhere in the world.  Of course, the unique relationship between Christian Poles and Polish Jews is duly noted as causing your perception.  Most people consider the Poles as superfriendly to Jews, but in fact the Polish commoners had no special like for Jews.  These common misperceptions would be best cleared up, if you kept all terms neutral as possible.  We don't need people getting upset and wanting to fight back and forth.  Your own feelings about being discriminated against by inconsiderate Jews going on their rants about the Holocaust, don't belong in the focus of an article.  You have every right to feel upset about the Blitzkrieg and Nazi occupation of your land, including your upset attitude in being slighted by the ignorance of foreigners who think that damage to your people was neglible or meaningless.  It is their ignorance and apathy that keeps them from forgetting about your loss, but Poles don't shove guilt upon the world about the Holocaust as many Jews seem to do.  Take it from me.  I used to have many misconceptions about the Poles and Wikipedia has changed them.

Nits and Appreciation from Robert Steele

1)  Second ranking civilian:  at the time there were about 25 civilians in Marine Corps intelligence.  The top person was John Guenther, an SES-6 who had been there forever.  I was the second, as a GM-14.  All others were GS-09 to GS-13.  It is an accurate fact.

2)  On the Drug War film, I did not volunteer.  The film producer got in touch with me because of my Amazon reviews, eg. LOST HISTORY on contras, drugs, and CIA, and asked if I could come to Los Angeles for filming.  I agreed provided he would pay my expenses, which he did, and I volunteered my time.

3)  The COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE book is my first book to be published that does not have my name on the cover.  I am turning now toward nurturing and aggregating others and although I have three chapters in this book, recommend it be listed.

If anyone wants to engage in dialog leading to improvements of this page (for example, my three most recent seminal articles on OSINT are at www.oss.net/OSINT-S, www.oss.net/OSINT-O, and at www.oss.net/HILL where my article on """"The Open Source Program: Missing in Action"""" is being read by virtually everyone either planning to attend or deciding not to attend the DNI OSINT conference

I also wrote the Joint Military Intelligence Training Center Open Source Handbook, and the Special Operations Forces Open Source Handbook, as well as the NATO Open Source Handbook, and will create stubs for the first two, should anyone wish to link to them.

If [WP:VER] is intended to be weaponized then a bot could be made that deletes pages and sections based on whether the section contains an insufficiently prestigious reference.  Treating WP:VER as an intentional algorithm would allow an attacker to delete perhaps as high as 90% of wikipedia without even needing to look at the content.  No one could invoke any objection to the mass deletion if the literal interpretation of WP:VER is the most important rule on wikipedia.  Vandalism becomes impossible if criteria for removal applied to a science page can be robotically applied to a philosophy page.
 The above attack would meet a common sense interpretation of vandalism.  The only possible protection from the mass deletion attack is if [WP:VAN] is considered to have higher priority for literal interpretation than WP:VER.  There should already be a common sense acceptance that Vandalism is more dangerous and objectively assessed than the quality of referenced material, and as shown above, rejecting the statement binds wikipedia to a suicide pact.  Its my view that the recent deletions are indistinguishable from robotic vandalism and they deleted high quality and verifiable references based only on the content hosting platform.
 If Vandalism and Verifiability are to be equally considered in actions, then restoring the content and tagging it as needing better sources should be done.  Also if there is to be a defense from robotic deletion of the majority of wikipedia, then """"deletors"""" that have shown no previous contribution to the page should be treated more suspiciously than those who have helped build it.

Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy or any other political system. Its primary (though not exclusive) means of decision making and conflict resolution is editing and discussion leading to consensus—not voting.

 And as for consensus vs. policies, see again WP:CONSENSUS:

Consensus among a limited group of editors, at one place and time, cannot override community consensus on a wider scale. For instance, unless they can convince the broader community that such action is right, participants in a WikiProject cannot decide that some generally accepted policy or guideline does not apply to articles within its scope.

1.) The Federal Governemnt does not automatically repay any loan deficiency, a lender can file to have any deficiency paid them via the Federal Government i.e. the FHA reserves the right to pay or not pay any shortfall

2.) These loans are extemely expensive for seniors and until regulated or limited more heavily I think they should be avoided i.e. upfront costs are absolutely too high!

3.) You may get 60% to 70% of your equity in monthly installments / payments but, you are also loosing equity in that the interest (you are not paying) is compounded on the back of the loan.  Interested is paid on the principal balance (growing each month) but also compounded on top of interest on top of interest.  So, when you get to the end of the loan you may have given up 30% to 40% of your homes equity to obtain a fraction in a monthly payout / installment.  It would be wise for seniors to sell instead of taking on this risky loan program.

 Islamic Science 

There's been some discussion previously of the need for an article on the History of Islamic Science.  At present there is a small section of that sort in the article on Islamic Science.

There's a real potential for tension there because two different groups are interested in the topic of Islamic Science, and these two groups define it in very different ways. I am concerned that the different assumptions of these two groups may lead to unnecessary conflict, which can be avoided by dividing the present article in two.

 The article """"Islamic science"""" seems to have been founded by advocates of a modern intellectual movement called """"Islamic science,"""" which seeks to establish the practice of science within a particular set of traditional Islamic religious norms. Thus the article defines """"Islamic science [as] science in the context of traditional religious ideas of Islam, including its ethics and philosophy. A Muslim engaged in this field is called a Muslim scientist. This is not the same as science as conducted by Muslims in the secular context"""" (my emphasis).

 Historians of science, on the other hand, find this definition excessively constraining, since we investigate the ways in which scholars within the Islamic world developed scientific ideas through original research and by drawing on and transforming the ideas of their neighbors and predecessors. It really doesn't matter to historians of science whether the particular scientist was Muslim (e.g., al-Khwarizmi), Sabian (e.g., Thabit ibn Qurra), Christian (e.g., Hunain ibn Ishaq), or Jewish (e.g., Hasdai ibn Shaprut), whether he advocated strict adherence to Muslim traditions (e.g. al-Ghazzali) or was critical of tradition and open to the ideas of foreign philosophers (e.g. Averroës), or whether he worked in a religious or secular context. If he studied natural phenomena and worked within the Islamic world, his work fits the historians' broader definition of Islamic science.

These contradictory expectations are likely to lead to conflict in two or more different ways:

 When historians wish to discuss scholars who don't follow traditional Islamic religious norms, while advocates of the modern movement would wish to delete these from the discussion. 

 When advocates of the modern Islamic science movement wish to discuss those modern scholars who contribute to the development of that movement, while historians would wish to delete them as not relevant to the historical development of science in Islamic cultures. 

Rather than go this unhappy route, I propose an amicable divorce, removing the section on the History of Islamic Science (perhaps renamed History of Science in Islam) and making it a separate article under the History of Science portal, and leaving the remaining article on Islamic Science as part of the series of articles on Islam.

 Cleanstart 

Hey there. I wanted to talk to you about your cleanstart. As a cleanstart account myself, I figured I'd give you some pointers.

First, take some time off between retiring from the old account and creating the new one. I recommend six months. I took well over half a year off, although I know people who have waited only three months or so, so really, it's up to you. The reason that this is suggested is that it a) allows you to cool off from any disputes, and b) you don't get caught immediately in the cleanstart.

Second, don't work in the new account in the same place you worked before you retired. This prevents all sorts of ethical issues, and again, it prevents you from getting caught immediately.

Third, once you do come back, shoot an email off to ArbCom. This protects you from being called a sockpuppet if people link the accounts later. You might also consider telling Tiptoey and MuZemike, the two most active CUs, again by email. They're both trustworthy. 

If you don't think you can do any of those three things, a cleanstart might not be for you. Consider the virtues of apologizing for whatever you've done wrong and working on improving. Most of us are pretty forgiving, and apologizes (genuine, unforced ones) are so rare that they're still cherished around here. 

Cheers, and good luck,  Wha? """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Your comments are interesting and may well be correct, however they don't really address the point I was making, regarding the gross, almost embarrassingly obvious, errors in the """"academic geek created/mindless computer driven"""" financial models currently used around the world.  The most similar """"theory"""" to the one I've pustulated above comes out of  this piece from """"The Prophet"""" Robert K. Landis, where he predictes a combined deflationary/stagflationary financial crisis.  Ludwig von Mises obviously had similar ideas, but no one has really done the """"hard"""" financial modelling on this Austrian School theory, and tried to collect long-term historical data, tracking changes in debt levels over time and compared this to volatility levels (the frequency and severity of so-called """"black swan events"""") in financial markets.  My hypothesis is that with increasing margin lending and debt levels, you will see bifurcating bell curve returns (i.e. extremely high returns or extremely negative returns, with few data points in the range of the long term mean during these periods of heavy net indebtedness).

Landis comes close, but still no (Cuban) cigar.  Anyway, his piece is very topical right now, and made for interesting bedtime reading, tucked away here as I am in my tiny little third class cabin, far far away from the """"mad money"""" crowd.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think the possibility of a corrupt core of admins is a problem worth asking candidates on. So if anybody else posted this exact question there wouldn't be a problem with it? Particularly, I imagine, if it were a well respected admin with an impeccable record positing it?

This is the question I posed to select candidates.
What general concerns do you think are raised by the 5 days of silence from the community's admins in this ANI? Are there any other general concerns which arise from the ANI?

Do these quotes;

ameliorate, add to or amplify concerns?

If you can point me to another ANI where lies and deceit by two admins within an ANI were ignored by the other admins in attendance for somewhere close to 5 days, then I will ask exactly the same question of those select candidates, substituting this with that example. Would that be acceptable?

Have you seen such examples of systemic corruption before? Or is this the only one? Of course to answer that you would also have to answer; can you say in all honesty that you think Ruslik did not lie in this ANI?

 Proposed Intervening Section on """"Controversial New York Times Story"""" 

Rather than argue over the title or contents of the disputed second section regarding the pertinence of the controversial petition itself, I propose to insert an intervening section about the controversy stirred up by the appearance of Kenneth Chang's 2006 story in the NY Times, wherein Picard's name is mentioned.  The reason I find it necessary to do this is because some elements of Chang's story, which report claims of the DI have been blithely elevated to facthood, without benefit of a critical examination of the reported claims.

Here is my initial draft for the new section, to appear below the biography and above the discussion of the controversial DI petition.

Controversial New York Times Story

In February 2006, the New York Times ran an investigative story Few Biologists but Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition by Kenneth Chang of the New York Times Science Desk, reporting that the Discovery Institute had launched a new websiteDissent From Darwin to promote their expanded public relations campaign regarding how theories of evolution should be taught in public school.  The new website included a list of signatories to an earlier petition which the Discovery Institute had termed """"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism.""""Signatories of 'A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism' The petition dated back to 2001 when it was first published by the Discovery Institute beneath an ad criticizing a forthcoming PBS series on evolution.2001 """"100 Scientists"""" Ad]  The headline on the Discovery Institute's 2001 ad was also """"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism,"""" although the petition itself, embedded at the bottom of the ad, did not carry that label (it bore no label at all).  The untitled 2001 version of the petition simply read, """"We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged."""" 

Chang's story disclosed that Professor Picard's name appeared on the petition cited by the newly launched Dissent From Darwin website, but the Times article did not distinguish which version she signed.  Indeed, Professor Picard's name first appeared on the original 2001 untitled two-sentence petition and her name remained on the subsequent controversially yclept versions, including the most recent one appearing on the new website.  Chang's story neither substantiated nor refuted the claims of the Discovery Institute that the two-sentence petition supported or endorsed DI's slant on its meaning, but the story did include a mixture of quotes from some of the people whose names appeared on the list at different times, including some quotes that cast doubt on the Discovery Institute's characterization of all the petition signers as variously """"dissenters from Darwinism"""" or """"anti-evolution.""""  Chang's story, in conjunction with the Discovery Institute's website and its attached list of petition signers left a wake of confusion over who among the list of signers of the earlier versions of the petition agreed with or consented to the Discovery Institute's characterization of the petition signers as """"anti-evolution"""" """"dissenters"""" who presumably supported the emerging and evolving agenda of the Discovery Institute.  It is at present unknown to what degree, if any, Picard agrees with or supports the Discovery Institute's controversial interpretation of the petition as """"dissent.""""  It is also unknown whether Picard has ever supported any or all of the ongoing political agenda of the Discovery Institute.

The last two sentences of the proposed new section reflect the absence of verifiable published information regarding the attitude of most of the original 103 signers.  So far, Wikipedia has only managed to obtain a reliably sourced comment from Stanley N. Salthe, who disputed DI's characterization and supplied his own salty attitude, """"A plague on both their houses.""""  

Skip Evans of the NSCE similarly casts doubt on the DI's interpretation, saying

I agree with Demiurge1000. Stanistani, please lift the ban on the account """"bryansee"""" on Wikipediocracy.com. I have no intention of posting what you unilaterally deem as unsuitable material. And you don't aware that the clear signal sent by admins on behalf of BatteryIncluded have a ripple effect throughout the Internet. You don't seem to distinguish the meaning of life and death of people on the Internet. And don't do anything to harm/destroy my computer with input device-disabling malware. Let me make myself clear about Wikipedia:

 The administrators and editors alike have turned Wikipedia into an online totalitarian regime, and no one has done a darn thing about it if they don't want to be immediately killed, beaten or received intimidating death threats. BatteryIncluded, Dennis Brown, AGK, and Boing! said Zebedee are said to be a part of them. They tend to use misleading and incivil statements as credible, accurate and correct. They also tend to use personal attacks and outs people as well. This is why they hate them as well.
 This explains cabalism in Wikipedia as well.
 This explains the unevenly enforced, extreme and heavy-handed rules enacted by the Wikipedia community, BatteryIncluded is such a prime example. Others outside Wikipedia really want to worship these rules as well - BatteryIncluded's ally """"forcedmemefred"""" is the first one - trying to protect Wikipedia from external harassment.
 Wikipedia editors, such as  died last April in a rock-climbing accident. Although a loss for Wikipedia, her death might have been deemed by the Wikipedia community as a """"human sacrifice""""; BatteryIncluded and his people perceived it as she's """"well"""", meaning that she has cured her paranoia. This may apply to me and you as well, as we have signed separate death warrants. I think I have to say that, any increase in their medication dose will not cure paranoia, instead it will be deadly to people. I guess that Wikipedia is not the only one, but also Wikipediocracy (by  as Zoloft), Encyclopedia Dramatica and Know Your Meme (via forcedmemefred).
 I think this is the fate that you are going to face later on, especially you are taking actions therein that are aimed at Wikipedia, just as what I've did.
 And, these events have signalled a neo-luddite sentiment against computers and other devices that has the capability to connect to a network given these events, namely computers being the cause of people's paranoia deemed by BatteryIncluded, forcedmemefred and his subordinates. Given the fact Wikipedia is being used to spread malicious code and has the tendency of giving people malware, this is the case for BatteryIncluded as he does to the computers of many users he is dealing with.
 BatteryIncluded is really the worst one I've ever seen on the Internet.
 He gives people kittens. """"Kittens"""" may be a bomb with a intimidating death therat. The kitten that BatteryIncluded sent me might be a bomb. And  is thought by BatteryIncluded to contain kittens.
 He has the reputation of distorting people's histories.
 He has the reputation of sacrificing humans via increase in their medication, as well as making death threats in the guise of """"seeing a doctor/therapist"""" advices, as well as inciting neo-luddism against computers.
 He is the source of inspiration of admins and activist alike making personal attacks and acting unilaterally to ban people.
 Every page on Wikipedia is outrightly misleading, and """"truth"""" is based on whoever edits last. This is why Wikipedia is unreliable in many days, and is a lost cause.

She was catpured at Carfou at you suspected, but her nationality remains a mystery. She sustained 11 wounded in her captured by HMS Goliath. Her crew numbered 44 men in1798 and 30 on 18 March 1799. She was armed with 6 guns, which in May 1798 amounted to 2 18-pounders and 4 1-pounder swivel guns.

77234,cee3e5625016d8d7,"A Short History of Republican Sinn Féin  

In 1902, Arthur Griffith, Editor of the United Irishman, presented to the third annual convention of Cumann na nGaedheal the most revolutionary political idea since the fall of Parnell; it was that the elected Irish Members of Parliament should refuse to sit in Westminster, demand reinstitution of the Irish Parliament of 1782, and pledge allegiance only to a king of Ireland, not to the King of England. While the Liberator, Daniel O’Connell, had once considered such unilateral action, he had not forced the issue. Griffith provided a strategy of passive resistance by turning an assembly of Irish MPs into a de facto constitutional convention. Modeled on Frank Deak’s policy, which resulted in the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867, Griffith serialized his abstentionist program in the United Irishman as the Resurrection of Hungary, and then published it as a pamphlet and distributed it widely in 1904. The direct result of this idea was the formation of Sinn Féin on 28th November 1905, as an abstentionist political party, with internal self-reliance as its principal plank, pledging never to recognize or use the services or forces of the enemy. The founders of Sinn Féin were Arthur Griffith, Seán T. O’Kelly, Bulmer Hobson, Countess Markiewicz and Seán Mac Diarmada. In addition to contesting a Parliamentary election in North Lietrim in 1908, Sinn Féin was also active locally, electing a number of men to county councils and other local bodies. 

Historian, lecturer, Conradh na Gaeilge president and Radio Free Éireann (public service broadcasting, 99.5 FM in New York) commentator Nollaig Ó Gadhra points out that the big change in Sinn Féin came in the Árd Fheis of 1917, when the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) under the guidance of Michael Collins and the Irish Volunteers under Cathal Brugha, caused Sinn Féin to change its policy from monarchist to republican abstention. After the Rising, Sinn Féin adopted an election manifesto for all elections, insisting upon the Irish Republic Proclaimed on Easter Monday, 1916. Éamonn deValera, campaigning in an Irish Volunteer uniform, was elected for East Clare in June 1917. At the Árd Fheis of Sinn Féin in October 1917, Arthur Griffith graciously stepped down from President to Vice President of Sinn Féin, to allow the election of deValera, who, after the death on hunger strike of Thomas Ashe, was the senior surviving Commandant from 1916. 

This was the Sinn Féin which contested the general election of 14 December 1918, promising to NOT represent their constituents or their country in the mighty Westminster Parliament in London, but rather to set up, without foreign let or hindrance, a Republican assembly which would form an Irish government for Ireland. Sinn Féin won over 79% of the popular vote in all Ireland, and 73 of 105 seats, in what can only be described as a plebiscite for independence. The delegates who assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin formed the First Dáil Éireann and issued the Irish Declaration of Independence on 21 January 1919 (legally the equivalent of the American Declaration of Independence by the Second Continental Congress, promulgated on the 4th of July 1776). That Easter Monday, 1916 is regarded as the significant date is a consequence of the pre-existing Army Council of the Irish Republican Army – Óglaigh na hÉireann (the IRA) insisting upon the First Dáil Éireann recognizing the Irish Republic proclaimed in arms in 1916, as a condition for the IRA coming under the authority of the government formed by the First Dáil Éireann. [See also Dorothy Macardle, The Irish Republic (New York, 1965).] 

The democratic voice of the Irish people had spoken (vox populi, vox Dei), and their elected representatives sought the recognition of their national self-determination as promised by American President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, on which basis the Armistice ending the Great War on 11 November 1918, had been accepted by the Central Powers. Ireland was denied recognition and a seat at the Versailles peace conference. The ensuing conflict between the forces of the Imperial Government in London and the Irish Republic has become known to history as the “Black and Tan War” (1919-1921). But, the military lessons of Dublin 1916 having been studied in the internment camp of Frongoch, the forces of the Irish Republic waged an asymmetrical conflict against the alien forces of occupation. Modern guerilla warfare entered on to the twentieth century. England, though still in control of many strong points, could no longer coerce Ireland into remaining peacefully within her empire. A Second (Republican) Dáil Éireann came together in August 1921 (124 Sinn Féin and 4 Unionist members). Nollaig Ó Gadhra, in Civil War in Connacht (Cork & Dublin: Mercier Press, 1999), points out that the Sinn Féin delegates regarded their mandate to be as Teachta Dála Éir",0,0,0,0,0,0

As I've reiterated, I have no interest in the other party, I'm focusing on myself here as well as my own mistakes, not his. I don't wish to be sucked into any further dispute with him when I can simply walk away, so why should I revert back to my ways before the block after the expiration/lifting of block? Serves me no purpose at all, and I've made known that my interest is in Wikipedia and Wikipedia alone, nothing else matters. Happiness isn't derived from gloating and/or commenting on the behaviour and/or block of another editor, so for the record, I'd rather be happily updating article pages of my interest than to be further entwinged with the other feuding party.  ♠♣♥♦™№1185©♪♫® """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I changed it back pointing out that four years contradicts the source cited, and he has again changed it back without explanation. I see that Janet Nelson in her DNB article on Æthelwulf also dates Æthelbald's reign as 858-860.

Well, I can't possibly assume good faith with you because I experienced your dirty tricks first hand and you are an editor who cannot be trusted. First of all, you went to ANI and requested a speedy closure to the AfD discussion immediately after you dumped your solitary faux RS, which you sweated blood to find, during the time that we, the pro-delete editors, were not around. And now that your lack of RS was due to a search with the diacritic tactic has been exposed as false, because both returned zero results at Google News (what would you expect from an unnotable subject?), you added the search word """"location: Philippines"""" on Razon. Should we now buy into this sleight of hand again and bin the diacritic? Why don't we try the same search with the diacritic intact. What happened? We get the same number of hits as the one without the diacritic! So, there is absolutely no point in moving the article. – Shannon Rose Talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Speedy deletion of Linesh
 A tag has been placed on Linesh requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.   | Talk  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Your undo of my deletion re: article Jennifer Oneill pic of her speaking at a public forum 

TO MIKE WAZNOWSKI: Look, I was the one ANYWAY who submitted that pic of the subject of the article speaking at a public forum in Washington, D.C. because the prior pic was removed due
to an alleged copyright violation.  So your alleged basis for undoing my deletion was
not justified since I was the original one who submitted the pic in the first
place.This pic which was """"nominated for speedy deletion"""" was taken at a public forum
and submitted in good faith BY ME, but was deleted anyway.  ANDI DID INCLUDE AN EXPLANATION
and did not deem it necessary in the talk history to include this (i.e. info that a prior pic had been deleted) as it did absolutely nothing to contribute to the article. 

I would add that for some unknown reason, you continue to attack me personally and undo virtually all of my edits here. You even undo my edits on the talk page!

You are obviously intent on ENGAGING IN AN EDITING WAR WITH ME and I simply do not know why.

Your editing here consists of nothing more than destructive deletions, undo s, and reverts of virtually everything I have submitted. """"If it ain't broke, don't fix it"""" should apply here instead of the motto """"If it ain't broke,  fix it until it is.""""  In other words there is something to be said for leaving well enough alone.  Some folks think something is just not good enough until they get their hands on it to destroy what they can just because they can. There is a place here to be constructive, which you clearly are not being, and this is my opinion which I am expressly calmly, coolly, and politely.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0
