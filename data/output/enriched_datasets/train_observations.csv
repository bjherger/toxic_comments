As the Da Vinci Code fictional story, Many disbelieve, that Mary had descendants through Jesus having children, as inconsistent with their core beliefs in Christianity imputing that if Jesus had children he didnt die on the cross and go to heaven. 
But Jesus having children was prophecied serveral times in Isaiah 
See -
He shall see his Seed - Isaiah 53: 10 
He shall sprinkle his Seed across many nations - Isaiah 52:15
Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and His Maker, ask me of things to concerning MY SONS ... Isaiah 45: 11
...
and so, then the subject cannot be blythly ignored with off point attacks about timing as Jesus having had children before he died on the cross and went to heaven, is not inconsistent with any Christian belief.

The only source for a rational discussion of this is the book, The Jesus Presidents laying it all out vs the off point rants about this or that

In any case, I hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian!

I have noted that you edit without an edit summary. Please do your best to always fill in the summary field. This is considered an important guideline in Wikipedia. Even a short summary is better than no summary. An edit summary is even more important if you delete any text; otherwise, people may think you're being sneaky or even vandalizing.

157701,e2438cb0845d96c0,"Khalatnikov 

JETP isn't scanned yet, so Khalatnikov's contribution, which seem to be closer to Candlin than Salam and Matthews (Feynman also does something similar to Salam and Matthews in one of the electrodynamics papers, but without the Fermionic coherent states, and without the justification in terms of sum over intermediate states, which are both found in Candlin for the first time, I think.) This paper talks about the result: the integral over Fermionic fields is defined following Schwinger so that the action principle will work, and the result is that the determinant is in the numerator and not the denominator. This is most of Grassman integration, but without the formal anticommuting variables, which seem to have been introduced by Berezin and Candlin independently (at least according to this source). I did not read the original Berezin articles, only the 1965 textbook, so perhaps they are more complete than I originally thought. If anyone has read these, please include a summary of the contents. The real question, in my mind, is as follows:

 Feynman's propagator approach only requires that the statistics be correct when permuting the ends of the paths. The rest can be done by summing over particle paths, with appropriate projections to deal with Dirac eqn. So the early authors, between 1948-1954 are all dealing with formal anticommuting variables (no complete theory). This is true of the Schwinger action principle, and to a lesser extent, of Matthews and Salam.
 Matthews and Salam, like Feynman in his QEDIII paper, treat the sum over histories as green's function manipulations, without trying to formally define a calculus of anticommuting fields. They do define anticommuting sources, and anticommuting field Green's functions, but this is similar to Feynman and Schwinger. It does not have the crucial addition that the algebra of the fields in space-time makes sense, and the Fermi field integral is a sum over intermediate states.
 Khalatnikov seems to have understood the modern thing: that the Fermionic integral is a concept that is well defined. Unfortunately, I cannot access his paper. If anyone has access, please find out what is in there.
 Candlin defines the whole thing, in a very modern way. This paper is the best on the subject I have read, but it is similar to Berezin 1964.
 Berezin has some papers in the 1950s and 1960s, which seem to develop the whole thing indepedently, starting with Khalatnikov's observation. These papers are also crucial- who develops the Fermionic coherent states? And who shows that the Fermionic integral reproduces the sum over intermediate Fermionic states?

The whole thing is somewhat implicit in Matthews and Salam, but also in Schwinger and Feynman. The real important development is the identification of sum-over-intermediate states with grassmann integral. If someone can point out who did what, it would help a lot.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Machida returned to his native Brazil to face Phil Davis on August 3, 2013 at UFC 163.[44][45] In a unanimous decision, Davis defeated Machida. This caused controversy among many MMA fans. [46][47] In one sample, 13 of 13 media outlets scored the bout in favor of Machida. ESPN scored it for Davis. [47] Davis had takedowns near the end of rounds one and two, and some moderate GNP, which formed the only significant offense of the fight. Many UFC affiliate bloggers and also scored the fight 30-27 in favor of Machida.[48] UFC promoter Dana White stated shortly after the fight that he had Machida winning all three rounds,[49] and later told Yahoo! Sports that """"Machida definitely won"""" and """"MMA judging sucks"""".[50] Fightmetric Analysis shows Davis struck machida more times. [51] ESPN released a similar analysis tracking each fighter's activity in each category, and reporting the 29-28 victory scored by the three judges at ringside.[52].77.101.41.108  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Copyvios on MP again

G'day SandyGeorgia. I thought you might be interested that I pulled an article from the main page today (T:ITN) that was a copyvio from start to finish: 2010 Colombia floods. It had been up for days and the copyvios were then when it was posted. I've been on wikibreak for a while so I haven't been able to follow what happened with the big """"plagiarism on the main page"""" discussion.

I actually did not intend to become a """"main driver"""" of the plagiarism discussion, nor did I intend to become """"Plagiarism Central"""", but alas and alack, so it has turned out )  What fueled that whole thing was me trying to discover how the """"reward culture"""" on Wiki was fueling plagiarism and copyvio at DYK to feed ill-prepared RFA candidates, and I never expected the problem to turn out to be as big as it has.  Anyway, I think we can summarize what has happened with that discussion as 1) slightly more awareness of plagiarism and copyvio on Wiki; 2) much more work for our few qualified copyvio people; 3) little change that I've been able to detect at DYK or ITN (but I don't follow closely enough); 4) circling of the wagons curiously in defense of copyvio by some ArbCom members and some extremely distasteful commentary coming from some arbs; and 5) curiously, even some resistance at FAC to tightening procedures to detect copyvio, with a second copyvio getting through FAC only a week after the Halloween mainpage debacle.   On the copyvio you detected above, I'm not certain you handled it correctly by stubbifying the article, rather than adding the  tag and alerting the copyvio people, you don't allow them to 1) look for other copyvios by the same author, 2) educate that author, and 3) remove the copyvio from article history.  You might want to go through those steps as well.   As to the lack of mainpage scrutiny, I 'spose it will take time, a few more debacles, and a few less unprofessional arbs before the issue is taken seriously.   (Talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Well Maybe theres a reason it was taken off. I think its because her voice isnt as good as it used to be. but still I say her range is Bb2-G#7 but all that can be proven is a range of C3-G#7. C3 is the lowest note in My All, Emotions, You're So Cold, and I believe other songs. A1 is my lowest note and F7 is my highest and Im a Lyric Baritone. I don't know if Mariah has ever sang above the piano or in the second octave because there is no audio to prove it. All I know is alot of people exaggerate her voice alot. Notes should be checked before saying what they are. People start rumors about alot of things like the note in You're So Cold being G2. Its not. My way of checking notes is by using a keyboard. its pretty accurate too. Its better than a tuner. Tuners can be thrown off by the slightest extra sound. the best way to check a note using a tuner is to copy the note by singing it yourself. But keyboards are easy cause it wont produce a note an octave lower or anything as most people tend to do if they feel a note is too high or an octave higher if the note is too low. You should always check a note yourself and ask another person if you can rely on them.  06:27",0,0,0,0,0,0

89822,f04947d0e606e6fe,"""== Removing Dyer references ==

I propose removing from the references section the books written by Dyer. I have not read Dyer's books, but from what Node_ue says, it seems to me that he's just a crank. He appears to have no clue in linguistics.

I don't think a sane linguist would take two random people, put them to translate a text from Yiddish, compare the resulting texts and get to the conclusion: """"yep, we have two different languages"""".

Also, he uses made-up expressions such as """"sovetul (sic!) de deputaţi"""" or """"cuvinte slujitoare"""" to prove his points, which is akin to data fabrication in regular science. 

Bogdan, Dyer did not come to the conclusion that Moldovan and Romanian are truly separate languages.
With regards to the parallel translation, he says """"the greatest difference between these two texts are in the vocabularies and in the styles they employ. There is a more 'flowering' prose in the Moldovan text... to reiterate, the difference here is one of style, not one of substance"""".

 Actually, """"le style est l'homme même"""", as Buffon once said. Dyer starts from the premise that the style in each country is homogenous: it is not, there are much more differences between different individuals in the same country. His ways of studying language is just as useless as the way the Nazis studied genetics by assuming the homogenity of the Aryan race.  

 Yes, that's his point. That nearly all of the differences between the two passages are not differences between two languages, but just because two different translators.
 Earlier, you said """"...a sane linguist would take two random people, put them to translate a text from Yiddish..."""". Actually, he got these comparisons from published translations in """"Romanian"""" and """"Moldovan"""". He didn't just walk up to random people on the street.  

The only actual possible grammatical difference he finds in the texts is Moldovan """"pe tot ce vretsi"""", and Romanian """"pe cît vretsi"""". There were very few web results for """"pe tot ce vreti"""" (about 5), and one of them was from the Zdob shi Zdub website (a Moldovan band). There were no results in Moldova for """"pe cit vreti""""/""""pe cat vreti"""". So that may or may not be valid. I personally would say """"pe tot ce vretsi"""". But I don't know if it's real.

 I suppose this is part of an expression, such as """"jur pe tot ce vrei"""" or """"pun pariu pe tot ce vrei"""". Anyway, both sound common enough in Romanian and sounds pretty subjective choosing one for Romanian and one for Moldovan.  

Now, neither of those expressions is """"made up"""". He takes both from M. Bruchis' work, """"one step back, two steps forward"""" which is also quite critical of the notion of an independent Moldovan language.

 But can this author prove they exist? Probably not, since no google hits are found.  

 Michael Bruchis, you mean? I'm sure he can. He's an expert, too. He wrote an entire book on the subject. Just because no Google hits exist doesn't mean an expression isn't real  do you find any Google results for cit vreti%22+site%3A.md or cat vreti%22+site%3A.md? Or even tot ce vreti%22+site%3A.md? No, you don't. But that doesn't mean that nobody says those things in Moldova. How many results do you find for """"instrumente gramaticale""""? 37, and none of them are at .md websites. You can find the word """"cuvintelnic"""" on Google, but does that mean it's really the Moldovan word for """"dictionar""""? No, Moldovan ppl only use that word when we're joking. (dexonline.ro finds 0 results too). Just because a term occurs or doesn't occur on Google, doesn't mean it is or isn't real.  

""""sovetul"""" is not a misspelling. Rather, it's a Soviet-era spelling  """"soviet"""" was spelt as """"sovet"""". Some Moldovans still spell it that way although it's usually considered incorrect; however he is quoting the phrase from Bruchis, who published his work a bit earlier when the spelling was still accepted.  

I agree with your opinion. Such an ignorant person like """"expert Dyer"""" can't be called expert. talk & contribs

NPOV
I have tagged this article as POV because it is filled with sentences like """"The Iranian Government security forces opened fire on protesters on the Shi'a holy day of Ashura, a day """"symbolically about justice"""" and during which any kind of violence is forbidden,"""" """"Irregularities during the 2009 Iranian presidential election caused resentment among many Iranians,"""" """"outspoken political dissenters were detained.[5][6] However, dissenters continued to speak out against the Government, leading to further protests in December 2009"""" and """"Security forces opened fire on the day of Ashura, the Shiite holy day """"symbolically about justice"""", a day which any kind of violence is forbidden,"""" which do not sound neutral or objective but like outright propaganda? 

Than in the protest section, rather than reporting the events objectively, quotes are used, not from people, but from pro-reformist articles, the result: """"Protesters in Tehran gathered  """"From Imam Hussain Square to Freedom Square"""", """"from east to west along Revolution Street"""", and it was on this day that """"the political and religious symbology of Iran's Islamic regime was turned on its head"""".[10] The protesters made another symbolic move- a """"symbolic journey from a square named after its most revered hero toward a monument dedicated to freedom, along a street called Revolution.""""[10]"""" is unbelievably POV, this should be immedietly changed to a proper written text which reports everything objectively. Meanwhile in the part about the demonstrations condemning the Ashura riots (which BTW, where much larger than the Ashura riots themselfes - a fact which was completely ignored by the writers of this wiki article), """"On December 30, counter-rallies staged and organized by the government at various cities, including Tehran, Qom, Arak, Shiraz and Isfahan called for the death of the protesters, with government workers receiving the day off work in order to attend the demonstrations"""" the sentence """"with government workers recieving the day off work in order to attend the demonstrations, was added in such POV manner and clearly to discredit those demonstrations.

Now although it is mentioned how rioters set fire cars, shops, banks and power stations (though other vandalism by the rioter isn't mentioned at all), this is such small part of the article. The violence by rioters (against people) is not mentioned at all, meanwhile there is a complete section devoted to alleged government violence against the protestors. The article is also clearly written with a goal of reporting only what is good for the green movement, this is illustrated not only by the POV quotes but by for isntance the way that whenever government claims are reported, they are immedietly rebuffed with other POV claims, leading me to believe they were only included to """"expose"""" the government as liars (which is POV). An example is """"Although official sources in Iran denied involvement of security forces in killing of protesters, at least one amateur video shows, the security truck which was deliberately running over the protesters.[16] Other evidence says that security forces were armed with guns and shot at protesters, including one amateur video showing a plainclothes security force directly shooting at protesters.[17],"""" with source 16 being non-existant and source 17 being a vehimently anti-Iranian blog showing a video of a gunman, of which there is no proof he is associated with the police of basij. In the article he is however labelled as a """"plainclothes security force."""" All in all, this article definetly needs to be re-written.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Umm, he shouldn't be categorized as anything specifically, as is how they've generally done it with all prominent people who didn't leave enough information on wikipedia.  And Madison is often considered to have been a straight-up atheist privately by historians - but that's kind of the point, that it's still very unknown, though he clearly rejected standard theism.  I'd be inclined to consider him a deist (which, btw, should not be capitalized) but it is not a religion, nor does it say anything about other beliefs that would encompass a religion.  98.168.192.162  

Actually, the word could just be changed to """"religious belief(s)"""" - rather than simply """"religion"""" as it stands - or something similar, and for that, I think """"deism"""" could be used since it's seemingly the most accepted stance he had (or am I wrong)? `98.168.192.162  

The word's from the template (which is outside this topic).

 Dubious 

Someone needs to rewrite the War of 1812 heading - """"British insults"""" """"hostile indians"""" """"american's didn't really want canada"""" - come on, lets see some neutral and TRUTHFUL info. Sure the British were impressing """"American"""" subjects into the Royal Navy and the NATIVE AMERICANS were at times hostile but the Americans weren't saints. To be honest the War of 1812 was one of the biggest disasters America has faced - their invasion of Canada bloodily repulsed, Native Americans supported by the British and Canadians, A British Army torching Washington DC (in retaliation for the torching of York during the winter season) and ending up marching at will around central america doing what they wanted until a peace treaty was signed. American prestige was only """"restored"""" after a meaningless battle in New Orelans AFTER THE WAR ENDED. Regardless of what people say, this war did not prove Young America could hold their own against the old world, it showed they bit off more than they could chew in attempting to subjugate and forcibly liberate Canada against the populace's will. Don't forget half the canadian population were loyalists during the American revolution and Britain was fighting the might of Napoleon in Europe, so the War of 1812 was something of a sideline campaign. I may have rattled on a bit here butI think it just goes to show that that section needs rewriting to seem something other than some super-american-patriotic propaganda machine.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 86.136.246.144

Jen, work permitting can you do me a favour.

 Explanation 

Hi, I thought I'd explain why the pages keep getting deleted. The long and short is that we're really not quite sure what you are trying to do. The pages are given extremely unwieldy titles that are written like sentences, which makes them an unlikely search term. The pages also didn't assert how Razin was notable. 

I think that you were likely trying to write about Stepan Razin, as he was part of the Solovetsky Monastery Uprising. However I don't see anything on his page to show that he was an artist. You commented somewhere that there were paintings of his on eBay, which makes it unlikely that these two Razins are the same person. It's possible, but extremely unlikely. I think that the Razin that's a painter is probably a far more recent person since a search for """"S Razin"""" (the name that comes up in the eBay auctions) shows that he's from the 21st century, not from the 1600s.

 Changes between editions 

I AM QUOTING the current wording of the section: """"Changes between editions""""

""""Former Mormons, and now critics of the LDS church, Jerald and Sandra Tanner have claimed to have documented almost 4000 changes in the Book of Mormon.[37] The vast majority of these changes have been discussed in official Church publications ....""""

The part """"Former Mormons, and now critics of the LDS church,"""" was just added and it raises a question in my mind.

It seems from our article that """"official Church publications"""" and critics of the church AGREE that there have been numerous changes to the text of the Book of Mormon.  If so, the numerous changes seem to be a matter of fact, not a matter of controversy.

In this case, could the section be written in a more straightforward way?  In particular, starting the section with the views of two critics of the church seems to me to suggest that it is a matter of controversy.

Hi ,
 Re 1 and 2: I don't have access to any additional facilities.  I am a run-of-the-mill editor like you, not an administrator.  Flagging suspected copyright violations is something any editor can do; it does not require administrator privileges.  The procedure for doing this is described on WP:CP.  It does take an administrator to delete a page, however, which is the usual result from suspected copyright violations.  The notice is posted on the article in question, and on the WP:CP page, nowhere else.  Again, I have no subscription to EB, nor any tools except search engines for detecting copyright violations.
 Re 3: If you scroll down WP:CP, you'll see it consists mainly of reports, with the occasional comment, many of which are not from the original poster.  Typically the original contributor does not respond at all within the seven day window.  There are many new contributors who happily copy-and-paste from other websites, with utter disregard of their copyright notices, and our policies.  Have a look at some of the listed items for examples.  Most entries on the WP:CP page are in dated sections under """"New listings"""", but some have """"fallen off the top"""" into """"Older than 7 days"""".  
 Re 4: If you look at the original report on WP:CP#July 11, you'll see that  listed that URL.  Presumably the same URL also appeared in the original copyright notice.  How that URL was found, I have no idea, but I would suspect search engines before spyware.  8-)  It's by a human comparison of that page with yours that I perceive a certain amount of similarity in phrasing and structure.  I'm prepared to accept that it's within the bounds of coincidence.
 Re 5: You are correct; permit me to clarify.  People often reproduce text from other websites citing permission with various constraints like """"in Wikipedia"""", """"for non-commercial purposes"""", """"providing it is quoted without alteration"""", or """"on condition that the source is credited in a particular way"""".  Unfortunately, none of those (except perhaps the last) is satisfactory for text in Wikipedia for the reasons I explained above.
 Re 6: New articles can be seen at Special:Newpages.  Changes to all articles can be seen at Special:Recentchanges.  Everyone has their own criteria for which entries they check, but most people are more suspicious of anonymous users than of logged in users.
 I note with regret that  has just blocked you for 24 hours.  In the same circumstances, were I an administrator, I would probably not have done this, but you have to admit that you did twist each other's tails quite a bit.  Perhaps this will give you a chance to concentrate on your other project.  8-) Note that you can still edit your user page, and I think you can still send e-mails using the """"E-mail this user"""" link.  I'll add a note to both entries on WP:CP that we are in a dialogue.
 This is probably an unnecessary remark, but I feel I should point out that if you edit Wikipedia from a different address and identify yourself to me, I will feel obliged to report it as block evasion.  This is independent of my feelings about the block itself.  Sorry.

A proposed deletion template has been added to the article Horse Isle (video game), suggesting that it be deleted according to the proposed deletion process. All contributions are appreciated, but this article may not satisfy Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and the deletion notice should explain why (see also """"What Wikipedia is not"""" and Wikipedia's deletion policy).  You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the  notice, but please explain why you disagree with the proposed deletion in your edit summary or on its talk page. Also, please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the proposed deletion process, the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the speedy deletion criteria or it can be sent to Articles for Deletion, where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached.

Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, Nathu La incident. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as you. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Sino-Indian relations. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will continue helping to improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Sino-Indian relations - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled """"Click here to contest this speedy deletion,"""" which appears inside of the speedy deletion ({{db-...}}) tag (if no such tag exists, the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate). Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit the the page's talk page directly to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact one of these administrators to request that the administrator userfy the page or email a copy to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia. Try not to be discouraged. Wikipedia looks forward to your future contributions.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

True, it is in a gray area, but the subject could not control the source, and there is nothing to gain from a sanctioning body giving an award to someone unworthy. I think we can be certain he earned the titles. The frustrating thing has been finding truly independent sources. My hope is that someone somehow can come up with better sourcing for this. I guess gray sources are better than none.  Then there is the AfD debate. Does the fact the sport lacks main stream media coverage mean the sport and its champion's are not encyclopedic? Again a gray area, but sometimes if one is to risk erring, it's better to err on the side of the article if one cannot find certainty. In the past, I've seen a discussion go to keep based on similar, to me at the time, trivial coverage and miserable (to me) sources. Currently, I've been gnashing my teeth and wringing my hands over spending ours to come up with one or two measly sources of other articles.  '''Cheers, ) Dlohcierekim'''  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Rholton.  What I'm trying to do here is create a good article that contains all the information on these towns that is presently in stubs.  All the stubs can then redirect to this article.  If they weren't just stubs, but proper articles, then there wouldn't be a point.  They are not about to become more than stubs though, as I created the stub on Euroa about a year ago and it's still a stub.  If some become large articles then I can just have a link to them from this article.  It can also link from """"list of victorian towns"""" which names each town.

The way wiki immediately took down the 8 prime spirals pages and the minor referer pages about the person that discovered it way back in 1995 who also has a new project known as HelixQ is a joke.

Let's see the argument of wiki is that the 8 Prime Spirals are not 'peer reviewed', in academia anything involving crypto and national security has been censored for decades and in 1995 when the original paper came out revealing numerous new prime theory that was years ahead of prime theory then, there was no way for such work to even be published, so USENET was how it was distributed, and it's a fact usenet has been heavily edited involving the topic.

Now you can all point to your rules about 'peer review' but this shows how ignorant everyone thus far is about academia and censoring of math involving primes and crypto. Let's see wiki has a page on Dr. Bernstein, a guy that took the NSA to court in 1995 the same year the paper was released, so that's how restricted publishing prime theory as it relates to crypto was in 1995, and is still today.

You expect NSA funded journals like AMS to allow such information to be 'peer reviewed'?

Anyway, my original article was 'heavy handed' killed by 'mods' at wiki and if you don't think the NSA has infiltrated wiki and almost every type of mass social media on the net (and yes to me wiki is a social media/project) then you need to read on the Snowden documents.

So the article put a light on some very interesting 'prime theory' that is supported by GitHub, anyone can check the github cite to see the info that every so-called prime algorithm and many have pages on wiki, all failed to outperform a 2300 year old algorithm, aka sieve of Eratosthenes, all expect for one algorithm, a prime spiral algorithm that I KNOW has been around since 1995 and a theory that has been heavily censored by the NSA since almost any reference to the many posts about ENNISA Prime Formula has been erased from Usenet, the original 'social media' of the net.

That all being said, I'm constantly now being 'threatened' by who? Mods that think me insisting the removal of the original page is suspect to obvious manipulation most likely by the NSA?

Prove wiki has no NSA bots or mods controlling the discussion, put the page up and let it be edited properly. 

The original article was what I would think any real mod not working for the NSA would agree was pretty NPOV, and the 'cite' to github verified the whole claims, that a new prime algorithm is beating all known prime algorithms, something the other wiki page prime algorithms do not do.

The original article referenced the discover is connected to obvious 'disinfomation' as well, and the continued supression of anyone discussing his work and him as was done by wiki in this article is defacto proof that the PTB want to keep the public and academia in the dark about significant advancements in prime theory.

Anyone can google NSA and the major journals you think are 'peer reviewed', what do you see searching NSA and AMS, oh it's funded by the NSA. LOL

That's your 'peer review', so any real mod here can step in and put the original article back. The PyPrimes test of the algorithm shows how major this work is.

Then the public can decide who discovered it, I know the origin is 1995 and 1997, I've been following it that long, and to see wiki put up pages about a slow 60Mod algorithm from 2004 that was discussed in the same prime work in 1995 is a joke.

Then you start to peel away who are the guys involved in all this new crypto and prime work and you start to see nothing but NSA funded projects.

What you don't think the NSA had laws in place for decades banning such work? They did. And now they control the academic journals with funding to furthr control what is released about anything that can impact crypto and the heart of crypto is what, PRIME NUMBER THEORY.

The mere fact that a project that is open to PUBLIC SCRUTINY by competent computer programmers has shown for over two years a new prime algorithm is the so-called king of the hill of prime theory, and wiki mods and most likely NSA/wiki mods are doing their best to treat the PyPrimes speed tests like they are insignificant.

The fact is PyPrimes exposed how advanced the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni was by it beating all the major prime algorithms.

The fact is PyPrimes referred to the 1995 30Mod Prime algorithm as 'Croft Spirals', which is a joke since Croft created his site about the theory in 2010, then in 2012 PyPrimes picked it up, and now wiki is saying so what, there's a new prime algorithm that dethroned every prime algorithm wiki has pages on.

Certainly not. The alphabet has been copied """"as is"""" from Swedish, and it has been so since Mikael Agricola began writing Finnish. Fortunately the Swedish alphabet contains enough sounds like Ä and Ö that Finnish speakers didn't have to design any new letters. Then again, unused letters like Q and Å remain. The last changes to Finnish orthography with respect to the alphabet were the changes from 'C' to 'K', 'X' to 'KS', 'TZ' to 'TS' and 'W' to 'V', in the 18th and 19th century.

Well, once again you are ignoring several facts about what happened in Peru during those years. Let me explined them to you in a easy way so you can understand a lot better about peruvia politics:

- Fujimori, as President of the Republic, was invited to a asiatic forum that was held in Brunei, 2001. During those days, The Opposition parties manage to impeach Dra. MArtha Hildebrant, President of the Congress and member of Peru 2000, Fujimori´s political Party. It was widely know that they would try to impeach Fujimori from Office. They did it 2 times, and in the last vote (wich was extremely controvertial) they succeded.

- 16 de septiembre: Fujimori llama a nuevas elecciones generales y dice que no participará. (Reuters y Dpa). Fujimori WAS PRESENT in Peru after the Vladi-video. 

- Peruvian Congressman Javier Diez Canseco is one of the most untrusted members of this failed parlament. If you didn't know, he was an active member of the EXTREME Left during the times of the Civil War here in Peru. He was involve in several scandals during the 80's for his open suport to Sendero Luminoso. He was in China (representing Peru in that Communist country) at the time of the self-coup, and he lost his seat in the chamber of deputies after that. It is not surpricely that he had exagerated much of the information that he use and his open hate towards the former President is widely know. Besides that, Public enterprises here in Peru where already collapsing becouse of the saturisation of APRA Party Members in those institutions.

- Peru is in resecion for other motives. Since when international financial crisis does not affect some countries? you are ignoring the fact that during 1997 there was also a mayor political crisis her due to the hostages in the Japanese emmbassy. 

- The Constitution of 1993 IS NOT retroactive. Fujimori was elected with the 1979 constitution. According to some lawyers, this make him possible to run for a 2th term under that constitution. (he was democraticaly eleccted in 1995 with the 1993 constitution.) It was controvertial, it's true. But most of the power struggle here was caused by the fact that the most important (before the 90's) political parties in Peru were already tired of being ignored by the electorated.

- If you are trying to sell me the idea that the poor terrorist were slaughter with no feeling by the Army, you are completely wrong. May I remind you that it was a war zone? that the poor terrorist where armed with ak-74 and that they have and RPG inside the embassy? Oh, of course that Aministia international will defend them to death, since is their job to do that. I agree with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe when he said that they only care about terrorist and not their victims. once again, this is a patetic effort by yours to rewrite history.

- That order was removed several days latter due to the fact that it created a political storm here, becouse Fomer President Alan Garcia is also accused with the same and is free walking around Lima. Due to political Pressure by the APRA, it was removed, and if you know, that minister was already fire from his post.

Please, read carefully and don't go around trying to rewrite history. We don't forgot ours, but it is sad to see how missinformed can be the world about what really happened here.

Protected Mode was first introduced in Intel 80286, providing mechanism protecting resource and assisting multi-task OS such as UNIX, OS/2 and so forth, and enhanced in Intel 80386 processor by extending computing capability to 32 bits from 16 bits, eventually becomes part of IA-32 architecture. Most x86 OS only running within protectected mode such as Windows NT, Linux, and so many BSD distros; but MS-DOS working under real mode, some extender might switch through and back from protected mode for extending physical memory addressing, likewise, Windows 3.x also transit itself from real mode and protected mode thorugh and ack too. Windows 9x not only depends the real mode as bootstrap, but also sits itself from and to that mode. 

Long Mode is a kind of protected mode, not a real mode, but does not belong to the Protected Mode in IA-32, switches itself out of IA-32 dominated Legacy Mode, to a completely self-contained mode, which means even though a x64 processor eliminates its legacy part, it would be fulfunctioned. From the aspect of implementation, or Microarchitecture level, the legacy mode codes could share the same physical execution resources designed for the x64 codes, without needing additional physical execution units for itself, like it found in early Itanium processor. So IA-32 architecture might or might not have relationship with x86-64, x64, AMD64 or Intel64. 

 IA32e and AMD64 

AMD64 is a switched-out architecture from IA-32, providing compatibility mode to support most IA-32 software and representing itself in the Long Mode within AMD64 processors. It is a new architecture, even though most lying on IA-32 architecture. 

IA32e is not a mode, but an extention of IA-32, or newer revision of IA-32, introducing 64-bit computing capability for its fundemental architecture. Intel EM64T is the new brought feature to this kind of processors, enabling it for 64-bit computing. Of course, EM64T is not a mode too, but a feature like PAE, could be enabled to extend the 64-bit computing capability. Without EM64T enabled, Yamhill processor would act like a tradtional Pentium 4. 

After EM64T enabled, 64-bit registers would be visible to applications. 32-bit traditional OS might need minor fixes to support applications referring 64-bit registers to do the 64-bit computings, but programmers must take care of the computing results without intervented by other processes. But most likely as it in PAE, OS might need a patch to support this feature totally, at least to manage the extended descriptors and extended 64-bit registers and stacks and so forth, but without needing to compile the OS from the scratch like it in AMD64. Virtual Address might be extended up to 52 bits, while physical address up to 46 bits. 16K segments of 4GiB could be spreaded to 64TiB physical space, with or without paging. Because the difference between 32bit and 64bit computing is bit width of register rather than the whole system, so 32-bit and 64-bit codes is also differentiated by the referenced resgistered without needing a submode, such as compatibility mode to support tradtional 32-bit software. 

After EM64T disabled, Yamhill processor would act like a Northwood Pentium 4.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Redirect from hoax page """"Hamlet of Denmark"""" 

Hello ! I just wanted to point out that the redirect that you created from Hamlet of Denmark should point to Prince Hamlet (which is the article dedicated to the character) and not to Hamlet. Best regards! (talk) 
 I thought about it, but the play also has King Hamlet, the ghost. (I have no preference either way; if you believe Prince Hamlet would have been a better target, I might reduce the protection for a while, so that you can change it.) -   
 Well, I confess that I have absolutely no idea about how to find whether people who search for """"Hamlet of Denmark"""" are more interested in the prince or in the king. I would say the prince, but it would be only a conjecture. Given the ambiguous nature of the expression, your choice seems the most reasonable. Sorry if I didn't give a better thought on it before contacting you. Cheers! (talk)

 US emissions description is totally contentless now. 

The US section is total nihil. It is nothing more than a circular self-referencing system of cryptic abbreviations, without absolutely any kind of numerical data to back it up! I guess you do not understand? Well, based on the wikipedia info a US """"partial zero emissions vehicle"""" could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.

Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.

Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.

It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad """"20mpg"""" reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.

For it would be unthinkable for someone to directly accuse him of the same behavior of which he so loves to accuse others.

Did he realize that he claims I made allegations of stalking to paint myself as a victim yet in the same remarks he claims Wikistalking on himself?

As for the attacking of the external link  he still has no proof I am that person who he claims that I am. This is the same debacle he got into with . And how fucking funny is it for him to claim I am that person, yet three paragraphs later he has to go and claim a checkuser?

As I recall, the """"classic 6"""" teams were in a league that operated like a country club.

Also, they aligned the new teams in a separate division, which essentially made the Stanley Cup finals an exhibition series for the winners of the """"classic 6"""" playoff rounds.

 Demonising Turks 
It is obvious from certain Wikipedia articles that many people are using it as a vehicle to demonise Turks. Wherever possible articles derogatory to these people are being written, media and writings manipulated so that when a search is done of Google - only one version - a completely Christo-Armenia, Greek Othodox version can be found. It is seems that as in America, Armenian and Greek lobbying is alive and well here, too. What a shame that Jews, who found solace in the Turkish Ottoman Empire, while the rest of Europe was have progrom festivals have come on board, too. It seems that all that it needs to get the Jew and the gentile on the same wagon, is to beat the tired old donkey issue of the barbarious Turk. 

It wears thin. 

To be honest, I don't want Turkey to join the EU. I want you and teh editors and admin that are like-minded to carry on with your actions. We need to perpetuate the misnomers and misrepresentation of the Turks. Forget the Royal Academy's exhibition last year about these people. We need to keep isolating them.

Thanks for updating me on what a conflict of interest is. I know what it means. I have read somewhere on wikipedia that if it appears that a contributor is only writing about one subject, there is likely a conflict of interest. This is a fairly broad and unfair generalization. 

I happen to have noticed a hole where a wikipedia page ought to be, filled it, and now any subsequent activity related to this subject comes from pride for my work in this instance, specifically to make the best wikipedia page or pages I can. Isn't that the point? Doesn't wikipedia as whole benefit from this?

 biggest problem? 

the only problem with all of this is that Wikipedia IS evil.
With all of the rules and all of the noise, what it still comes
down to is a mob of people doing whatever they want as a mob, against reason, against fairness, against logic, and against truth.
Theres no way to deal with abuse and no recourse for the abused. The place runs on ad hominems and pack psychology. It panders to the lowest common denominator, and in the end its articles are well neutered of any actual depth content or meaning. """"Neutrality"""" as a buzzword is used to emascualte a topic so that it has no political
implications or consequences. The same standing is given to a pov warrior and a pet admin as is given to a knowledgable expert. Opinion rules here, not wisdom, and not even any real form of neutrality. Wikipedia IS factually evil. The question here, is how
to go about fixing that problem. Denial won't help.

Well, enough bothering with pearls and swine for today, my """"contributions"""" file should speak for itself. I have been involved in 3 vfds since showing up, each one of which was run on ad hominems and straw man attacks. I have been blocked on trumped up charges by a pov warrior and his pet rogue admin. I have sought from every corner of Wikipedia some sort of actual problem solving process to adress patent abuses, all to no avail. Wikipedia is in fact evil, and it deserves to fail as an encylopedia unless it can
solve its problems. Unless wikipedia can figure out how to not be a mob groupthink social experiment where any idiot, fool, con artist,
or propagandist can assume equal footing with knowledge and fact,
Wikipedia is just a big fat doomed social experiment, which will die
because enough people will recognize that it is in fact evil, and go
do better and more important things with their time, like start A REAL online Encylopedia that includes logic and knowledge and truth and basic criteria for defining abuse and basic methodlogies for dealing with it.

Endurance
Q: """"Thank you for the welcome and tips! I would like to move some of the stuff on the Endurance and the Expedition out of the Shackleton article, since their scope is really quite a bit larger than him - can I do this? Is there any special way? """"

A: Absolutely yes!  It's pretty easy....just pick a concise and appropriate name for a new article on the expedition and start to build new content there.  You get started by putting the new article title in the search box.  If it's available you'll get offered a link to start a new article with that name.

I suggest putting some comments on the discussion page of your new article describing what you are trying to accomplish (same thing goes for the Shackleton article).  That way, other editors won't misunderstand what's going on.   If the new article is going to be under construction for awhile, it's a good idea to put a """"stub"""" notice at the bottom of it so folks know that there is more to come.  You add a stub notice by putting this at the bottom of the page: {{stub}}

As the new article takes shape and adds breadth and depth that the parent article lacks, you may find you need to tinker with the parent article to ensure that there is the right amount of detail there...not too much and not too little.  

Lastly, you'll want to find out what other articles exist that should link to your new article and add links on them.  That requires a bit of searching and digging around but usually isn't a problem and helps integrate your article into the broader encyclopedia.

Good luck with your article!  If you need any help, don't hesitate to ask.

 Armour 

A source that is not listed as an inline citation in an article is not a reference, it does not point to any specific text in the article. It is """"further reading"""" material unless it can be used to verify text. 

Notes and References
Shortcut:
WP:FNNR

Notes and References appear after See also (click on image for larger view).
Main page: Wikipedia:Citing sources#How to format and place citations
Contents: These sections present (1) citations that verify the information in the article, and (2) explanatory notes that would be awkward in the body text. Some articles divide this type of information into two or more separate sections; others combine it into a single section. There is no consensus establishing a particular structure when footnotes and the works cited in those footnotes are placed in separate sections.
Title: The most frequent choice is """"References""""; other articles use """"Notes"""", """"Footnotes"""", or """"Works cited"""" (in diminishing order of popularity). The title """"References"""" may be inappropriate if the section contains both explanatory notes and citations. Several alternate titles (""""Sources"""", """"Citations"""", """"Bibliography"""") may also be used, although each is problematic: """"Sources"""" may be confused with source code in computer related articles; """"Citations"""" may be confused with official awards or a summons to court; """"Bibliography"""" may be confused with a list of printed works by the subject of a biography. With the exception of """"Bibliography,"""" the heading should be plural even if it lists only a single item.[9]

Further reading
Shortcut:
WP:FURTHER
A guideline on further reading sections is proposed at Wikipedia:Further reading.
Contents: An optional bulleted list, usually alphabetized, of a reasonable number of editor-recommended publications that would help interested readers learn more about the article subject. Editors may include brief annotations. Publications listed in Further reading are cited in the same citation style used by the rest of the article. The Further reading section should not duplicate the content of the External links section, and should normally not duplicate the content of the References section, unless the References section is too long for a reader to use as part of a general reading list. This section is not intended as a repository for general references that were used to create the article content.

 Figures in the infobox... once again 

I found this:

The Russian defeat of Berlin was inevitable for they outnumbered the Germans in men 5:1, guns 15:1, tanks 5:1 and planes 3:1. < that's a lot more (2x more men, and no German artillery in infobox at all).

Until recently the Russians had claimed that they lost 10,000 men during the battle for the Seelow Heights and 100,000 in Berlin. The actual figures are unknown. Yet no less than 30,000 Red Army soldiers were killed at Seelow, and the staggering figure of 600,000 killed in Berlin seems more plausible. Konev complained at one point that he was losing 1,000 men a day because Zhukov's artillery failed to shift fire when asked. Zhukov denied that allegation, stating that Konev was not using his troops intelligently. < now a HOLE DAMN LOT more (Wikipedia now claims only 81,000 Communist soldiers were killed in the whole operation, while even the OLD Soviet figures were appearently more 100,000 in the city alone). 

I'd like to note Battle of the Seelow Heights says 35,000 Communist soldiers were killed in this battle, which is even more than claimed by these sources.

Other source (modern Russian): The Battle of Berlin was a costly and bloody one with over 300,000 Soviet casualties. The number of German losses is unknown but roughly 480,000 were taken prisoner. (infobox says """"134,000 captured"""")

Still another: However, it should be noted that the Soviet Union placed their own casualties as over 300,000 in the two weeks of fighting from the Oder to the collapse of Berlin.8This number included killed, wounded and missing. Interestingly, recent western sources place the total casualties suffered by the Soviets as even higher. (...) Although the exact estimate of Russian casualties during the battle for Berlin is unclear (infobox says """"81,000 killed"""", etc - while everyone knows the Soviet numbers were completely unreliable.)

How about just not putting any figures, as are really just unknown? 

Also, Britannica about overall Soviet (unknown!) losses:

Available estimates of Soviet casualties vary widely. A Soviet officer  who served with the high command in Berlin and left the Soviet service in 1949 placed total military losses at 13,600,000 8,500,000 dead or missing in battle; 2,600,000 dead in prison camps; 2,500,000 died of woundsand estimated civilian casualties at 7,000,000. These figures have been widely accepted in Germany, but most U.S. compilations, based on Soviet  announcements, list 6,000,000 to 7,500,000 battle deaths. Calculations made on the basis of population distribution by age and sex in the 1959 U.S.S.R. census give some credence to the higher figures, for they seem to indicate losses of from 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 males of military age in World War II. The figures used here are a compromise estimate, not intended to obscure the fact that Soviet casualties are, in reality, unknown in the West.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm wondering now about the variants that are not covered by them. (All OR of course.) In sho shogi (standard shogi without drops and with a drunk elephant) surely the step movers gain in value. Meanwhile in dai shogi, does the bishop get a colourbound penalty? (Because they're both on the same colour, unlike chu. Dai-dai gets around this problem of odd-ranked boards with its asymmetrical setup, but at the cost of a large increase in the number of piece types.) Hmm, a read through Betza's """"About the Values of Chess Pieces"""" is surely going to help here. ;-) If you like, we can discuss it somewhere whenever we need to blow off some steam.
I still like the sho/chu/dai/tenjiku quartet for the consistencies between them, though. In dai-dai and above I think too many things have changed with the promotions (e.g. kirin to great dragon instead of lion, phoenix to golden bird instead of free king etc.) for my love of consistency. Though the promotion by capture rule makes me think of WOTN (yes, teh complicated and kewl one!).

 Rindge article 

Hi DH,

Thanks for getting in touch about the population figure in the Rindge, New Hampshire article.  I did hesitate about restoring the info, because every edit you've done has been thoughtful and informative.  As I alluded to in the edit history, basically if you see a town in New Hampshire with a 2005 population estimate figure, it's because somebody first put in a figure and called it """"2005 Census"""".  Since there is no such thing, I consult the state Office of Energy and Planning web page, which conducts yearly population estimates, and retrieve the published figure for that town. (Concord and Peterborough are a few other places where I've had to do that.)  I can see the point of wanting to stick with just the decennial census figures, but I also see that there is a lot of pressure out there among readers to come up with more recent population figures  it may be boosterism, but it also may be caused by people concerned at how rapidly their community is growing.

I read the guidelines for external links before adding this one and I did not see this rule so I am asking whether mere association with a web site is grounds for removal if the web site is otherwise a worthwhile link. I am not deriving any financial reward from generating external link traffic. Since that time I have also moved from anonymous to being a named user as that may have aroused some suspicion. Otherwise I thank you for keeping Wiki clean.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I agree with  that “Georgian scripts“ would be a better title, or perhaps “Georgian alphabets” or “Georgian writing” (although this might be confused with Georgian literature). I certainly agree with the proposer that the present name is unsatisfactory, as the article covers three distinct scripts, and at least alludes to the existence of more than one mkhedruli alphabet. That said, I don’t have a strong objection to “Georgian script”, which would at least be an improvement, and seems to line up with the Latin and Cyrillic articles (the latter seems to me particularly worth emulating) in comprising a range of regional & historical varieties.—1479 """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now mr dictator you response is rubbish. your suppose to review the evidence not act as prosecuting council for one stupid man , Its civil behaviour is what matters and his  is an absolute disgrace. he's the one who started the incivilty calling my redits vandalism when they were prefectly appropriate. you should look at all the posts on rod laver, tennis staistic and jimmy connors . look at the responses of carlo colussi and german friuend and see what they think of tennis arrogant. I will call him as many names as I want until he reforms and does not act like a facist policeman , he needs to be stopped and told off regularly; he is a disgrace; i repeat a disgrace. look at the evidence ( i have no idea how to use any of  the fancy tools on wiki; so your gonna have to put some work in , but that's your job if you volunteer to get involved in bitter disputes) ; that you let such an arrogant man act with such  a massive ego operate freely is totally wrong and your taking his side reflect very badly you. men like him should be sworn at and told what people think of him. I have never used swear words against him but have used descroiptions that are accurate. look at his recent self serving post on rod laver to carlo and his digraceful censorship of my legitimate  comments; he is not a censor or a dictator ' but acts like one; he needs to be brought to heel and your helping him because  your  stopping crticism of him. he is an absoloute disgrace. plenty of people have criticied him but he never, never apologises. its beyond a joke. its war as far as l'm concerned and its being going on for 5 months mate and is not going to stop  until he is broughy to book.

Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC): Electronic Plagiarism Detection
http://www.jiscpas.ac.uk/apppage.cgi?USERPAGE=6588
JISC completed a plagiarism project in 2001, and they are establishing a plagiarism advisory service as a result of this experience. There were 4 parts to their plagiarism project, and they include:
1. Technical review of free-text plagiarism detection software 
2. Technical review of source code plagiarism detection software 
3. A pilot of free-text detection software in 5 UK institutions 
4. A good practice guide to plagiarism detection
A listserv has also been to continue discussions dealing with academic dishonest and plagiarism issues.
A copy of JISC's Technical Review of Plagiarism Detection Software Report can be accessed at http://www.turnitin.com/static/pdf/luton.pdf.
.
JISC Plagiarism Advisory Service
http://www.jiscpas.ac.uk/
JISC Plagiarism Advisory Service is a new offering that began in September 2002. It is based in the Information Management Research Institute at Northumbria University (UK). New materials are constantly being added to this plagiarism portal, but it currently offers advice & guidance, educational materials for students and other online resources. A plagiarism detection service, supported by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) until August 2004, is based on the turnitin.com platform and allows instructors to conduct electronic comparisons of work complete by students.
JPlag
https://www.ipd.uni-karlsruhe.de/jplag/
Guido Malpohl initially developed this software which is designed to detect academic dishonesty. The software does more than merely compare the text of documents. JPlag also looks at program language syntax and program structure so it can also be used to detect stolen software parts. Instructors may use JPlag for free, but they must first set up an account in order to prevent unauthorized use by students.
Library Electronic Databases
http://www.library.uiuc.edu/orr/
The Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign provides access to numerous electronic resources for students and faculty. Instructors may want to consult these resources when checking for plagiarism. Full text databases like EBSCO and Expanded Academic ASAP (InfoTrac) are two obvious starting points when checking undergraduate assignments. One thing to keep in mind is that some resources that are not full text but provide abstract information are often used by students.
Moss
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~aiken/moss.html
Moss or Measure of Software Similarity is a tool that has been used primarily to detect plagiarism. The way it works is that it detects similarities of C, C++, Java, Pascal, Ada, ML, Lisp or Scheme programs. Moss is free to use for instructors and staff of programming language courses only.
Plagiarism.org
http://www.plagiarism.org 
University of California Berkeley students and alumni created plagiarism.org to be used to detect plagiarism. One thing to watch out for is that the software doesn't differentiate between quoted materials and original writing. 
The Plagiarism Resource Site
http://www.plagiarism.phys.virginia.edu/
Lou Bloomfield, Professor of Physics at the University of Virginia, is the sole author of The Plagiarism Resource Site. The goal of this site is to """"help reduce the impact of plagiarism on education and educational institutions"""". Numerous links are provided to sources on how to deal with plagiarism.
Turnitin
http://www.turnitin.com/
Turnitin, a plagiarism.org partner, considers themselves to be """"the world's most widely recognized and trusted resource for helping prevent Internet plagiarism"""". Free trials are also available, and subscription costs vary depending on the type of plan chosen.
Turnitin is currently the subject of a copyright controversy. For more information, check out the following article, """"A Plagiarism Detection Tool Creates Legal Quandary"""" at http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i36/36a03701.htm.
WordCHECK
http://www.wordchecksystems.com/
WordCHECK is used by a diverse group including information researchers, copyright attorneys and classroom teachers. This plagiarism detection device was developed by Information Analytics, a Lincoln, NE company owned by Kenneth Livingston and Mark Dahmke. WordCHECK may be purchased for a fee.

Not a handful.  Gays don't have to wear signs.  But there should be more than one drinking establishment that caters to them.  The one dike bar on 4th ave is usually pretty dead, as is the one on 5th ave.  The point is there IS no gay community.  A few lesbians does not a community make.  But I'm not denying that lesbians call the neighborhood home.  It has been a liberal neighborhood for 30 years.  The point is, the term itself, Dyke Slope.  I don't like it.  I've never heard it.  I don't think its appropriate for Wikipedia.  And don't tell me what to do.  I can type whatever I feel like on this page.

I think you sound like a delusional, academic lesbian who wishes you had a neighborhood of your own.  I've never even denied that lesbians are found in the neighborhood.  My point is that while they have always been present, perhaps in greater numbers than elsewhere, they have had minimal impact on the neighborhood. They certainly have not been numerous enough to warrant a term like """"Dike Slope"""".  The reality is lesbianism is largely an academic phenomenon.  It doesn't surprise me in the slightest some professor would make such a claim.  But, that one class does not trump a substantial portion of my personal experience over many years.

Enter Batwoman
This character made her debut in Detective Comics #233 (July 1956), written by Edmond Hamilton and illustrated by Sheldon Moldoff. It seems clear that her introduction was part of a publishing decision to alter the ambiance of the series. Memories are vague on this point, but the responsibility may have rested with DC publisher Harry Donenfeld's son Irwin. After Whitney Ellsworth moved to California to produce a Superman television series, Irwin Donenfeld was serving as de facto editor in chief. """"He came in and he had a lot of things that he sort of threw at us,"""" recalled Batman editor Jack Schiff. Then again, Schiff himself believed new characters would bump up sales, and everyone seemed eager to provide Batman with some female companionship.

Glad to read you will be trying some editing methods different than what you've been doing up to now. I've been a Wikipedia contributor since early January 2005. I'm not an administrator. There's plenty I don't know…including how it can possibly be that despite a giant chorus of editors and admins telling you you are violating WP:OWN, you continue to insist there's no ownership issue, and that you're right and everyone else is wrong. You seem to feel that the AN/I case was opened to harrass you. In fact, it was opened to prevent much worse consequences (such as your being banned from editing Chevrolet Vega, or from editing at all) down the line. I tried — as did many others — to help you understand the problem. You flatly refuse to do so, and for that reason I have great difficulty taking this present friendly chat of yours at face value. You've got an awful track record to rectify, and as of just a few hours ago you were still building that bad track record. Perhaps that's just face-saving bluster, and your behaviour really is going to change quickly and substantially. I hope so, because you obviously have a great deal to bring to the project. But your long record of crummy behaviour makes that hope extremely thin. Please prove me wrong. — T·C""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Disney Channel Controversy 
On December 23, 2011, a rebroadcast of the episode """"Party It Up"""", where a female character complimented CeCe's brother, Flynn, with the line """"'I could just eat you guys up...well, if I ate"""" aired on the channel that evening. Former Disney Channel star Demi Lovato, who left Sonny with a Chance in the fall of 2010 for counseling because of personal issues, commented on the episode, criticizing the network through Twitter for including a joke about eating disorders when she had struggled through the issue herself, and as one of the reasons for leaving the company's fold. Disney Channel's public relations account responded to Lovato by stating that that episode and an episode of So Random! which had an eating disorder joke would be pulled from the network's airing cycle and reviewed further.https://twitter.com/#!/DisneyChannelPR/status/150418514426081281 Later in 2012, the episode started airing regularly on Disney Channel with the offending joke removed.
Disney Channel did not broadcast """"Quitting Cold Koala"""" on its originally scheduled date of May 17, 2013 and showed a rerun of """"Kids Don't Wanna Be Shunned"""" instead. The episode did, however, appear on the Disney Channel website, """"WATCH Disney Channel"""", and on """"Disney Channel On Demand"""", the channel's video-on-demand service. Disney Channel announced on their Facebook page """"We are removing this particular episode from our regular programming schedule and will re-evaluate its references to gluten restrictions in the character's diet"""". The edited version of """"Quitting Cold Koala"""" aired on July 5, 2013 as part of a 2 episode spectacular. All gluten jokes were removed in the revised version.
On January 28, 2014, Disney Channel announced that a TV episode of Good Luck Charlie will feature two lesbian moms in """"Down a Tree"""". This caused a protest from the conservative group """"One Million Moms"""" who told the Disney Channel company to not include it. Despite the protest, Disney Channel featured it anyway. Other people including actors Miley Cyrus and Evan Rachel Wood praised the episode and supported it.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Re: Giovanni's mother (The Woman Boss)
I see in a recent edit you made to Giovanni that you made a hidden (is that the word? I mean those tags that have the """"!"""" sign in them and are visible only in the edit box) question concerning the bit in the article about Giovanni's mother. (i.e """"WTF is this?"""") It's true that this is not exactly mainstream knowledge, so let me explain:

In Japan, a """"radio drama"""" (which as I understand it is basically a Pokémon episode without the animation) was produced, which was about the story of Mewtwo until the events of the first movie. Part of the radio drama was the short """"Birth of Mewtwo"""" video that also exists in English.

The story is narrated by Giovanni, who tells us about when Team Rocket was led by a very beautiful woman that he then identifies as his mother. This woman is referred to as On'na Boss, meaning the Woman/Female Boss. Jessie's mother Miyamoto, a TR agent, brings to her attention the existence of Mew from a recording in the Andes, and On'na Boss sends her to investigate. Miyamoto eventually finds Mew, but is subsequently lost in an avalanche and never heard of again. The story then continues with Giovanni's own attempts to find Mew one generation later, whose results we all know. Hope this cleared things up without being too long-winded!  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think there is possibly scope for a separate article.  For most applications of tensors to engineering (e.g., rigid body dynamics and stress analysis), it is not necessary to accommodate the general coordinate systems of tensor calculus.  Usually there is some fixed background frame and at worst one needs to know how things transform when that frame is rotated.  Then raising and lowering of indices is also not required, and all of the tensoriality is essentially quite trivial (so suitable for engineers).  It seems to me that this is the intended scope of the article, but it might be helpful if it stated this plainly somewhere, although it is possible that I might have misunderstood what is meant by """"rectangular coordinate system"""".

But assuming that the tensoriality of things is supposed to be trivial here, then the article should not dwell too much on this aspect of things (as it presently does).  The likely audience of the article will only get confused by this, and those looking for a more comprehensive treatment of tensors have other articles to select from.  I think some time should be devoted to discussing examples.  A good one is the inertia tensor and Sylvester's law, in my opinion, because it's very easy to visualize (for instance, in terms of a spinning plate or something).    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

No, I will make sure that will be removed permanently.  I will not do this for awhile to avoid violations, but hope that someone else will consider and agree.  There is no reason whatsoever to put """"the late"""" in front of his name, I will list several reasons, and although I think that is somewhat POV, there are other reason as to why I remove the info:
Everyone dies sometime - Does it really make sense to have an article about a past event and just put """"the late"""" in front of everyone that has died?
Poor writing - It's just sloppy/filler writing to put """"the late"""" in place.  Would you ever see anyone referred to as """"the late"""" in a print encyclopedia?
Recentism - WP has a guideline/template that we should try not to capitalize too much on recent events and keep them in perspective.  Would it make sense 10 years down the road to still refer to him as """"the late""""?  Let's make things as static as possible.
Precedent - At one point, several dozen articles referred to Steve Irwin as """"The late Steve Irwin"""", now, this is the only one that does (by doing a search), and there seems to be consensus about that.
Knowledge of his death - Let's face it, a vast majority of people (especially those that would look for this article) know he is dead, and the few that may not be sure can click the link.  Maybe people don't want to know that he's dead or be reminded of it, and putting that acts as a spoiler.  Even Anna Nicole Smith had a few """"the lates"""" put on pages of hers, and those have all been removed (a few by me, a few by others). """"Saving a click"""" is not a valid reason for this, we should assume that the readers are smart, and things like that can go to the Simple English edition.
Irrelevance - Why would the fact that he is dead be relevant to an article that talks about his programming?  His shows will probably be reran for many years to come, and the fact that he died somewhat unexpectedly makes no bearing on what he did on his programming.

Well, this is my case, I would also like to point out WP:OWN, which I feel has been violated in these reverts.  I also am starting a discussion on WP:Words To Avoid to get some word from other editors to make sure that I am doing the right thing.
