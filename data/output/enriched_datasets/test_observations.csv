 this page states his death date at 160ce. 
 G.R.S. Mead, via Hoeller,  http://www.gnosis.org/valentinus.htm  claims Tertullian placed Valentinus death much later than 160ce. by claiming that Valentinus lived after 175ce.   However, Tertullian himself was  born in 160, therefore if Tertullian was speaking first hand as a personal acquaintance it would mean that Valentinus death was later than the listed 160ce.  However, I'm not entirely sure how much of Tertullians history can be trusted as he also placed Origen and Valentinus as personal acquaintences, but by any timeline they could not have overlapped.    
 Could someone please note these problems to at least educate the reader for potential errors?  
 Which death date is correct?

 : I do apologize for harsh words, but it is very frustrating to see people denying about history. I did provide pertinent information. The far-right Japanese politicians only argued about the exaggeration of the numbers of deaths, but they never argued about whether the massacre excist or not. Why? Because they can't deny it doesn't excist. Even by saying that the number is exaggerated proves to us that they admitted this massacre (otherwise where would the numbers come from?). They are trying very hard to make the number as few as possible so that it justifies the event as a """"small thing"""".

 == Esperanto == 

 Hello, I responded to your question about Esperanto in my , but I'll post it here, too [timestamps reflect time of original posting]: 
 : Well, I just don't like it 
 :*I think the -oj and -aj sounds for plural nouns/adjectives are really ugly. 
 :*The attempt to include sounds from many languages seems excessive, and not conducive to ease of communication of people from different language backgrounds as an international auxiliary language 
 :*The inclusion of case is superfluous considering how many people just use the sentence order of their native language (SVO usually). 
 :*Why do adjectives agree with the noun for number but the definite article La doesn't? 
 :*The verb forms are hopelessly simple and yet the table of demonstrative/other pronouns seems to go on forever. 
 :*Vocabulary seems to be derived randomly from either a Germanic or Romance base with no logic behind it. 
 :*""""Fake"""" language history (saying that """"ci used to be in common use but now people just use vi"""" ... parallel to """"thou""""?)  Come on, Zamenhof 
 :*The flag looks like an Islamist-Communist organization's flag 
 :*I would like to see people put more effort in learning natural languages than Esperanto.  And just because some people are freaks and taught their children Esperanto as a native language doesn't make it a """"natural language"""".  Those people will creolize the language into some sort of Esperanglish... maybe.  While an interesting experiment in the whole Whorf-Sapir thing, I just don't see a use for it.   
 :*The whole philosophy of """"one language for the world"""" is actually frightening to me and 1984-esque.

 ==They Shoot Horses, Don't They?== 

 Re Jeune: What's the threshhold for including horses in this necrology?  Seems to me there are lots and lots of """"Cup""""-winning horses that could be included, but do we really want to?  Wouldn't we then have to include names of Best in Show dogs and cats?  Call me species-ist, but I think this list should be limited to humans.    

 I agree, animals don't belong here. It also seems to be a rather parochial addition as the vastly more significant Danzig also dies this week but didn't garner a mention.   

 : This question comes up with monotonous regularity, and we go thru the debate all over again every time.  It's like recreating the wheel about 6 times a year.  There really should be a clear rule about this so that everyone knows for certain whether animals are in or out.  You can't let one horse in and exclude others.    

 Personally, I think that animals should be included on the list.   

   Yeah no horses!  

 I think if it's an animal that would be known outside the niche (say like Koko the Gorilla or Dolly the Sheep), then it's a candidate for inclusion. Otherwise, forget about it.   

 Wouldn't it be a better idea just to have a seperate page for recently deceased famous animals?   

 :In previous discussion, the consensus was that there are too few of them, per month, to bother with a separate page.   

 I agree with Rai, a separate page for the animals would make more sense...   

 ==Ariel Sharon== 
 What's with people's egos lately?  Ariel Sharon is sick but still very much alive.  Twice now his name has been added and removed.  Can't people just wait till a guy is actually dead before adding him here?  Being the one to add a new name is really not that huge a deal.    
 :Apparently there were silly rumours in Israel that the government are covering up his death.    
 ::I thought doctors said he would survive under any circumstance. Has this been changed? Or was I misinformed?-   

 ==Sago Mine deaths== 

 While everyone agrees that the deaths were very sad, none of those listed were """"notable"""" in the sense of this encyclopedia.  If these names are kept, then I would petition for the names of everyone who has ever died in such an accident to be added to Wikipedia.

 == Carnival in Germany, Switzerland and Austria == 

 Hi Symposiarch I'm referred to you by , who suggested in our discussion  that you may know more about Carnival traditions than she. 

 I'm still puzzled by the tradition of starting Carnival as early as 11 November rather than at Shrovetide, but here my specific question has to do with this paragraph which doesn't seem to make sense (my emphasis below): 
 :*Although the festival and party season in Germany starts as early as the beginning of January, the actual carnival week starts on the Thursday (""""Weiberfastnacht"""") before Ash Wednesday. German carnival parades are held on the weekend before and especially on Rosenmontag (Rose Monday), the day before Shrove Tuesday, and sometimes also on Shrove Tuesday (""""Faschingsdienstag"""") in the suburbs of larger carnival cities. The carnival session [is season meant?] begins each year on 11 November at 11:11 a.m. and finishes on Ash Wednesday with the main festivities happening around Rosenmontag; this time is also called the """"Fifth Season."""" 
 Is """"the beginning of January"""" simply wrong, or is this another special date in the celebration of Carnival? It's all very confusing. (And I still don't understand in what sense a """"carnival"""" continues from November until Lent.) Thanks for any help you may be able to give.

 == Notification of my last RfAr request? == 

 Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Clarification#Request_for_clarification:_Abd-William_M._Connolley 

 It's looking pretty grim right now. ArbComm appears to consider the offense of clear and strong argument on an article talk page  one article  more important and more worthy of a ban than an administrator previously admonished by them for using tools while involved, repeating that, with the same action during the case, and consistently and tendentiously raising rejected arguments about copyvio, and banning users by presenting highly deceptive arguments at AN, while defeating the sense and intention of many ArbComm decisions. 

 All that matters is how long an argument is. Write too much, ban! 

 This was my problem with this RfAr. Yes, I could have presented a shorter request. However, I already spent a day writing and boiling down this one. I realized that I just didn't have the energy to go further, to put another day into further condensation for political effect. I don't gain a thing from being able to edit Wikipedia on the topic. I don't gain a thing from being unbanned except for a possible ability to help out occasionally on a topic where I've become expert; I'm COI, so I couldn't do anything controversial with the article anyway. Why should I bother? 

 So I just filed the damn thing. If ArbComm doesn't want to look at it  it's dense with information about the situation, and the purpose was clear  if they just want to imagine that """"the editor didn't change,"""" which is preposterous, they can certainly do that. I stopped editing that Talk page, almost entirely, before being banned, because it was useless if the article was owned, as it was. 

 They don't care if the article is owned. They passed General Sanctions, but the only application was to ban me, based on about a month of discussion that the banning admin acknowledged was """"not a problem, in itself,"""" when another editor at the same time continued a long-term pattern of tendentious editing, removal of reliably source material, without any seeking of compromise and consensus, previously banned for this and then recently indef blocked for the same, but on other articles, and the admin previously sanctioned for use of tools while involved continued his prior campaign against old enemies (I'm only one of them!), etc., etc. They don't care! All they care about is that they don't have to read the complaint, and look at the evidence, too much work! And they are not interested, my experience, in how the structural problem of too much to read could be addressed.) 

 Experts are always interested in their topic! What do they expect? 

 In any case, this will leave me freer, if ArbComm ignores the implications, as it seems they are wont to do. I will have exhausted due process, which I had not done before. I respected the first ban, and had respected this second one. With due process exhausted, my compliance becomes no longer a matter of obligation, I have nothing to preserve, no quid pro quo. I've rigorously avoided disruption other than related discussion on an article talk page. I do not know what I'll do, and ... I wouldn't say if I did. 

 I'll say this, though. There are promises implied in """"the encyclopedia that anyone can edit,"""" and """"the sum of all human knowledge,"""" and there are obligations that arise naturally. Because the defacto process at Wikipedia compromises neutrality, which is essential to the understanding and realization of human knowledge, and because Wikipedia is standing in the crossroads, it becomes an enemy of human knowledge; many others have concluded this before me. I was holding out, and this may be why I left it for so long to appeal the latest topic ban. I did not want to conclude that. 

 Wikipedia has not seen what would happen were I to treat it as a battleground  as has been claimed about me and others. I rigorously followed policy and respected blocks and bans, even when they seemed preposterous to me. At the end of the road, however, there is no road, no confining path, I can move in any direction, unconstrained by expectations. 

 I have my work at Wikiversity, which has been quite successful, for what little has been done. An extensive discussion with a user with a knowledge of physics there, at subpages of v:Cold fusion might seem to have been much hot air, but it led to a recognition of a lacuna in the experimental evidence on cold fusion, and there was a study done by an expert in response, which means that discussion led to the advance of human knowledge. (The expert is a skeptical one, by the way, but he concluded that the objection being raised to certain excess heat measurements was bogus.) While there were other reasons to consider this, independent verifications of results and experimental contro",96,0.100041434,0.0061488617,0.085267,0.002788299,0.060966074,0.023314243

20789,22cb7fc2771f9ca9,""", 5 November 2012 (UTC) 

 I've been off-wiki during this whole thing, so this is my first opportunity to respond: 
 *I'm amazed that Bidgee was unblocked after his unblock request and the ensuing discussion, which only made things worse. They started off complaining about the IP, which is a classic reaction to a block and normally enough in and of itself to decline the request. They got even more strident, essentially making demands and threats and attacking admins who disagreed with them. Bidgee even had the gall to say they wanted to work with Materialscientist who was willing to conditionally unblock rather than BWilkins who was not (""""I'm ignoring you ...""""). 
 *I don't even see that Bidgee actually agreed to Materialscientist's rather generous condition. Also, the unblock reason is not very clear. I don't see any evidence of Gibraltar Hill being locked. Actually, I'm glad it wasn't because it would have made the condition meaningless. 
 *As for my block in the first instance, first, I don't see socks lurking around every corner. Perhaps that comes from lack of experience, but no one accused the IP of being a sock, and usually those accusations fly at the drop of a hat. Moreover, just because they are an IP who seems to know the ropes doesn't automatically make them a sock - it just means they have experience here before. I did NOT assume they were a newbie. Socking requires something more than using more than one account - the purpose has to be illegitimate. In any event, I'm not saying that they are not a sock, only that it's not as clear to me and, based on the record, it didn't excuse Bidgee's behavior. 
 *Second, I looked long and hard at whether both editors should be blocked. My first look at the article's history automatically set off alarm bells and, at first glance, looked like a classic """"block them both"""" situation. However, I went to the trouble to look more closely at the edits, reverts, and even the discussion on the talk page. I'm not going to provide everyone with diffs because I'm already going into too much detail defending my actions. What I saw though was a fairly typical battle between an experienced editor and an IP, where Bidgee treated the IP dismissively and, frankly, arrogantly. There was no reason to template the IP and label their edits vandalism. One of Bidgee's reverts was to reinsert a grammatical error into the article, and that wasn't part of a larger revert, that was all there was to the revert. Bidgee didn't come to ANEW to discuss the issue. They apparently just assumed they didn't need to. 
 *By my count, Bidgee transgressed 3RR, but the IP did not. I took into account the nature of the edits when counting. 
 *Bidgee did not revert again after the report was filed, but they edited the article. In my view, when you're reported for edit-warring, you stop editing completely; you don't say, as Bidgee did above, I can edit as long as I don't """"revert"""". You don't even permit someone to draw an inference that their edit might constitute a revert. Again, this is an indication of someone with a poor grasp of policy and an inability to control their behavior. Nonetheless, because the IP also edited the article (and did so first), that wasn't a material factor in my decision. 
 *Finally, going back to the present again, I'm a bit disturbed that Bidgee has been given so much support by Gnangarra and Nick-D. I have no problem that they disagree with the block or even feel that Bidgee should be unblocked, but my interpretation of the discussion above yields more than that, particularly an implicit endorsement of Bidgee's post-block behavior, which, in many ways, was worse than their conduct leading up to the block.

30706,3312aabb8d990d59,"""I am home..at last! 

 Awoke this morning in Manchester with period pains from hell ( I wish the government would legalise CRACK once a month for women)..the journey loomed ahead, so I upgraded to first class and encountered a well dressed oppressive old man who demanded my newspaper (wot is it with me and fucking loonies on trains?). 

 this is how it went... 

 I sit in an empty first class carriage, happy to be alone...to quietly bleed and moan. I spread out my newspapers and set about distracting myself from my womb that feels like a fucking evil Doberman is trying to eat it's way out. 

 An elderly couple come on and sit three seats in front of me. She is stooped and very old but a pretty looking old Dame, he is tall well dressed in check trews and sparkling white shirt. 

 He looks over at me then stumbles up to the seat across the aisle from mine and stared at my newspaper, then flashed a glance at me...basically communicating to me that he wants to read my Sunday Newspapers, but wants me to 'offer' them to him. I am no mood to placate old grumpy old men, he can ask me if he wants to read my papers. 

 He sits there and I can see out of the side of my vision that he intently staring at the newspaper...still...he then gets some courage and reaches over with his liver spotted gnarled hand and simply grasps them off my table in front of me. 

 My reflex action is there before he can escape to his seat..I grab at his wrist, pull out my IPOD earplug and say """"That is my newspaper sir"""" 

 His reumy old eyes flinch and he diverts his stare and gazes through me and mutters """" I thought they belonged to the train company"""" 

 me-""""Well even if that was true would it not be at least polite to ask me instead of grabbing at them? If I did that to you, you would insist that MY GENERATION had no respect"""" 

 He simply stood there watching me whilst holding my freshly bought newspapers, his wife watched with frightened eyes that told me he normally got his own way. Well, not with fucking me he ain't. 

 """"You could ask me if you can read my papers"""" I spoke to fill the dead air. 

 """"Can I read your newspaper?"""" he barked in defiance at me. 

 """"No..no way, not until you learn some manners Old man, now put them down and get back from my table"""" I hissed. 

 He threw my Sunday Times on the floor in the centre of the train aisle and threw himself onto his seat. 

 I simply leaned over and picked it up and sat there in front of him and slowly but very deliberately tore it into long equal strips..one after the other until I had managed to decimate the whole newspaper including magazines and sports sections...the noise ripped the air as I sat there smiling tearing away slowly but happily. There was a huge pile of confetti'ed Sunday news sat there right on my table. I missed nothing, in fact it was theraputic, all that destruction and slashing noise filling the air cured me of my angst and period pains. 

 The old man sat there, his face going purple, his anger seeped into the carriage, yet I smiled. 

 Fuck Him...he may be able to bully his poor wee wife, but I am not going to let any man ever bully me or make me feel that I should do anything to keep them happy. 

 I would have been that wee old woman had I not stood my ground years ago...in fact I think I was her for a short while.

 :My comment was in no form intended as an attack; if you saw it as such, please accept my most sincere apologies.  It is, however, my personal opinion that edits like this are silly.  This particular edit did not make any improvements; it did not fix anything; it merely constituted a technical interpretation of an editing guideline (not even a policy).  One or two such edits don't make much difference, but I wanted to point this out to you just in case you decide to do it systematically, in which case it would be a waste of everyone's time (including yours) indeed.  Hence my comment (and it is in """"so many words"""" simply because I have a propensity to blabber). 
 :As for the literal interpretation of the guidelines, please note that their intent is usually to prevent misunderstandings and useless reverts (like ours).  In general sense (not just within this guideline), when something is not broken, it is counterproductive to """"fix"""" it.  This is why we never change British spellings to American and vice versa, switch between different date formats, or between link styles unless something obviously needs fixing or otherwise creates problems.  With Turan, no problem existed before your edit, no problem was solved during your edit, and no problem appeared after your edit.  All in all, your edit was pointless.  In such cases it is always best to stick with what's already in place, especially because there just might be other reasons why the original contrubitor chose one style over another; reasons you might not be aware of.  In case of Turan, for example, piped link style is typical in vast majority of articles about the Russian inhabited localities.  With your desire to achieve universal consistency, surely there should be some appeal in preserving the consistency which is already in place?

And ever so often, his stated reasons for these edits is simply that the article does not deserve, for instant, an awards section, because the show """"IS SO UNPOPULAR!"""". He just claims that the show is not popular and was never popular to begin with, bu he can NEVER, EVER state where the got that piece of information (except occasionally stating """"my mother told me so"""").

 == I could have been. == 

 Had I taken an interest in Japanese culture (and Anime) earlier in life (particularly, the 7th Grade or sooner), then due to the immense turmoil at school through having a paraprofessional that year, I would have ran away to the West Coast, so I could sneak aboard a ship to Japan, and find a better life there. 

 In fact, I plan on sending to my former High School Counselor my thoughts on this """"what if"""" issue, so she can tell me what her thoughts are about this.  

 It may have been good to not run away, or it may have been good to do so and reach Japan (if circumstances and fate allowed for it). Regardless, I felt a great portion of my youth was wasted because of that year. Gone, at least 'til the day Dechronification comes along. 

 The Letter: 

 ''Dear Sue, 

 I am glad Mrs. Terri Miller gave me your email address at the Pizza Hut. College is fun and challenging at the same time. What has Chapman been like? 
 Now, I think it is time to get this “fantasy” out of the system. I regret not discussing this with you earlier, mainly because it did not cross my mind until after I reached college. 
 Remember when I had Mrs. Potter back in 7th Grade and how that school year was the most miserable ever for me? 
 Well what if the following happened: 

  
 December 1st, 1997 

 Mr. Sanborn tells me that it is a fact that Mrs. Potter will be with me for the rest of the school year, and that any further complaints about her will send me to ISS. Mrs. Potter tells me that now, she will be around me no matter what- whether I am good or not, she will be in all of my classes. The next day, I am to serve I.S.S. for whatever reason there was that day.  
 One thing is for sure- if Mrs. Potter were not there, I would not have had to serve it. Because of her, I got into a lot more trouble than other students did, even though they did many of the same things but got away with it. She was also ruining my reputation, which meant ruining plenty of chances to get a girlfriend, because fellow students would always see Mrs. Potter following me around, and to every class. 

 Once I get home, I decide, “I don’t need any more of her draconian authority. If this country does not care enough about the well-being and reputation of a kid they educate, then why do I need to stay here? If my parents love me, then why don’t they either remove Mrs. Potter or take me to a different school? I have reason to believe that I am not loved enough around here, so you know what? I am running away. Where to? I will reveal it down below. 

 With a pencil and paper, I plan my runaway. Factoring in the cold December weather, I put down what I need- 
 -Only one backpack 
 -Up to four waist packs 
 -Up to four of Dad’s spare wallets 
 -Wear three layers of sweaters, with one t-shirt innermost 
 -Wear 2 layers of sweatpants, with jeans as the third layer, belt included 
 -Wear ski mask 
 -Wear coat 
 -Wear three layers of socks 
 -Wear Gloves 
 -In available storage areas, put in 
 One Extra sweater 
 One Extra Pants 
 Three Extra undergarments 
 Two Extra pairs of socks 
 -Toiletries 
 -Toothbrush & Toothpaste 
 -Dental Floss 
 -Inhaler 
 -Trapper Keeper 
 -Some Game CDs 
 -Flashlight 
 -Battery-Laden Alarm Clock 
 -Easily Storable Food & Drink to fit the rest of the spaces 
 (Remember: This is not just a backpack; I will also have four waist packs, AKA waist pouches, so I can have the extra storage space that I need.) The next step is to find as much money as possible. That night, assume I find ~$350 from around the house, mostly from parents’ wallets. Yes, it would have been stealing, but it would not matter if I were running away to never come back. Then all of that money goes into the wallets. 
  	 Once I am done gathering and putting together all that’s needed to run away, I decide that Japan is a good place. All the technology, high life, Anime, and the abundance of girls! Some Youth Hostel could take care of me well there, too. Now how do I run away to Japan? There happens to be a Greyhound Bus station in Junction City. They can take me to Seattle. What if I need parental or a guardian’s permission, being 12 years old? No problem; I forge a note. I get another sheet of paper and write the following: 
 “Dear Greyhound, 
 My Nephew, Chris Cuervo, will rejoin his parents back in Seattle. We had a pleasant time with him but now is the time to send him back. Ensure he is safe during his trip home! 
 Sincerely, 
 Madeline Cuervo” 

  	 Then the note gets folded, and put inside one of the knapsacks. 12-year-olds usually do not have any ID. I would probably leave behind my Military ID card, though. You get those when you are 10 if you are a military family member",287,0.099965416,0.0061615505,0.08539138,0.00280538,0.060906354,0.023394104

 Hi Vsion! 

 There was some misunderstanding between me and Huaiwei recently over my redirecting of Government of SIngapore article to Cabinet of Singapore article. It started off from Template:Politics of Singapore, which you did a superb job of revamping. There was a link """"Government departments"""" which was listed under """"Cabinet"""", and linked to Government of SIngapore. 

 My understanding of the word """"government"""" was obtained from the article Government: """"In British English, the word """"Government"""" can also be used to refer only to the executive branch, in this context being a synonym for the word """"administration"""" in American English (e.g. the Blair Government, the Bush Administration). In countries using the Westminster system the Government (or party in Government) will also useually control the legislature"""". I took it that """"government"""" was synonymous with """"cabinet"""" (since we do follow British English conventions). 

 In any case, I took it that you meant for """"Government departments"""" to be something closer to departments of the United Kingdom Government in Template:PoliticsUK, since it was placed as a sublist of """"cabinet"""". 

 I would appreciate it if you could have a look at Talk:Departments of the Singapore Government and Talk:Government of Singapore; this could potentially diffuse a very tense situation between the both of us! Thanks in advance for your help!  """,309,0.099848844,0.006135812,0.08479563,0.0027678262,0.060754597,0.02322823

 ::If you look at e.g. Titanic (1997 film) you'll see the infobox contains more information than just cast/crew members. Links, budget, distibutor, release date, running time, revenue etc are also there. Your argument would seem to suggest that the infobox should be split into separate sections and placed in the appropiate sections of the article - which defeats the point of the infobox. What would you do if for instance I found a source for the budget and placed it in the infobox? Would you concede the point and leave the infobox at the top? Or would you create a section on """"Budget and Revenue"""", put the budget information there then split that section of the infobox off and place it there also?

 == As a black man, I am disgusted by this """"let's pretend"""" article - whitewashing racially targeted hatred.  It makes me sick.  == 

  

 This article is disingenuous, ludicrous and appalling. 

 The knockout game is patently almost entirely about racially targeted attacks carried out by young black men against non-blacks. Live with it.  That's the story.  

 Is accurately reporting this story a hate crime against young people?  Against men?  Of course not.   

 This article is a hate crime against black people. 

 If a Wikipedia reader expects to read this kind of nonsensical reporting, it is a very sad day.   

 It's like reading """"The Ku Klux Klan was renowned for attacks on men.  They would sometimes lynch men.  They didn't want men to be part of American civil society"""" [DELETE REFERENCE TO RACE: NOT RELEVENT.  YES IT IS TRUE THAT VICTIMS WERE MOSTLY BLACK BUT THIS MAY HAVE JUST BEEN A COINCIDENCE OR A PRODUCT OF ANTI-WHITE MEDIA BIAS]. 

 If widespread hate crimes carried out by black people are censored like this, a reader is entitle to assume that ANY crime might be a hate crime carried out by blacks, but no-one can report it on Wikipedia. 

 This is the actual story, that seems unreportable on Wikipedia: 
 
 """"The New York authorities describe a recent series of such attacks and, because Jews have been singled out in these attacks, are considering prosecuting these assaults as hate crimes. 

 Many aspects of these crimes are extremely painful to think about, including the fact that responsible authorities in New York seem to have been caught by surprise, even though this knockout game has been played for years by young black gangs in other cities and other states, against people besides Jews — the victims being either whites in general or people of Asian ancestry."""" 
 http://nypost.com/2013/11/19/thugs-target-jews-in-sick-knockout-game/ 

 PS.  You god-damned prissy idiots who don't give a damn about black people, or facts, or accurate reporting but love self-righteous whitewashing just encourage nothing to ever be owned up to and nothing to ever be resolved.   

 Grow the hell up, with your stupid, juvenile fantasies and your bogus encyclopedia. 

 Black people are better off without you. 

 Oh, I haven't even got around to what the racially targeted Jews, Whites and Asians might think about this drivel.

 == Cyclone Studios == 
 hello, I'm gezegond, and you deleted my page some time a go. the reason that I'm writing this is that I'm a newcomer to wikipedia and I don't understand why you deleted my page, but from your User page I understood that you're someone that deletes a lot of pages. Before I began writing in wikipedia, I used it a lot to get info and after some time I felt that it's time to add some info my won. I read all the guidelines before I started writing in wikipedia. The page that you deleted """"Cyclone Studios"""" took me 5 to 6 hours to complete, I gathered data about it and I carefully added to wikipedia. Of course  it was not perfect. It didn't have any real good sourced material and It might not have enough notability, but It was some info about something that wikipedia had nothing to offer about it before. 3 or 4 pages were linked to the page and when people clicked the links they would face a """"page does not exist"""" note. so I put some info I could find together and created the page to help other people. It lacked notability but it was not a stub, and it was sourced. Wikipedia guidelines say that if a page lacks notability you should improve it by adding some references, and if it lacks sources you should find sources on your own. It clearly says that deleting is the last resort if the page can't be anyhow improved. Yet you easily deleted my page. I was busy and I couldn't check my Wikipedia page and when I checked it I realized that my page is completely gone. no """"add references"""" sign, no """"lacks notability"""" sign. Just gone. and I'm not unhappy because you deleted my page but because you actually believe that you did the right thing! I think you are making improving wikipedia harder. deleting is not improving and bad data is better than no data. if you don't think it's not good enough, then make it good enough. deleting won't help. no page starts out being perfect. this act of yours makes professional wikipedia users the only ones who can add or edit a page because if someone can't make his page perfect, It gets deleted, which means that no info can't be added to wikipedia unless it's added by a professional wikipedia user and it's completely favorable to wikipedias structure, which is not very likely. So please answer me (on my talk page although i don't check it often) and correct me if I'm wrong. If wikipedia's content is """"be perfect or not be there at all"""" I might stop adding info to wikipedia, But I've seen a lot of pages that lack both reference and notability and are not deleted.

You can use them if you make a section surveying theories about their existence or not, though. Velikovsky reports most sources like this accurately (in my experience) but he is not RS. The bible refracts ancient legends coming from multiethnic traditions into an 'historical' narrative written in terms of theological patterns of thought. So even the verifiably historical elements are caught up in moralizing reworking (as is true of much ancient historiography and much modern journalism, for that matter). We cannot know whether the traditions re the Amalekites reflects a historical people or league of tribes: we can guess from the topology that they imbricate over the areas later associated with the Bedouin and, generally, Arabs. As the Arabs gain some ascendency (6th cent. BCE) the Amalekites disappear, and the authors who refer to the latter do so in mythifying terms, to create an image of an eternally inimical people. As such, we are there in the realm of theological myth, since no external testimonies are available to restore the lineaments of the Amalek tale to some form of recognizable historical reality.",440,0.0997307,0.0061147516,0.08497823,0.0027907675,0.060543276,0.023295049

 Hi, Billybass, Welcome to Wikipedia!  

 I hope you like this place — I sure do — and want to stay. Before getting too in-depth, you may want to read about the Five pillars of Wikipedia and simplified ruleset. If you need help on how to title new articles check out the naming conventions, and for help on formatting the pages visit the manual of style. If you need help look at Wikipedia:Help and the FAQ , plus if you can't find your answer there, check the Village Pump (for Wikipedia related questions) or the Reference Desk (for general questions)! There's still more help at the Tutorial and Policy Library. Plus, don't forget to visit the Community Portal. And if you have any more questions after that, feel free to post them on  or place {{helpme}} on your talk page and someone will be by to help you shortly.  
 - 	   
 ====Additional tips====  
  	  	   
 Here's some extra tips to help you get around in the 'pedia!  
 *If you want to play around with your new Wiki skills the Sandbox is for you. 	   
 *You can sign your name using three tildes (~). If you use four, you can add a datestamp too. Five will get you the datestamp only. 
 *You may want to add yourself to the new user log. 	   
 *If you ever think a page or image should be deleted, please list it at the votes for deletion page. There is also a votes for undeletion page if you want to retrieve something that you think should not have been deleted. 
 *If you're still entirely confused, or would like to get a better grasp of your wikipedia skills, and you have an IRC client (or don't mind getting one), check out the Bootcamp. It's not what it sounds like, but it is fun and can help you with your editing skills. 
 *If you're bored and want to find something to do, try the Random page button in the sidebar, or check out the Open Task message in the Community Portal. 

 Happy Wiki-ing. —

 Abstract 
 The different legal, social, and medical approaches to ritually based male and female genital circumcision in the United States are highlighted in this article. The religious and historical origins of these practices are briefly examined, as well as the effect of changing policy statements by American medical associations on the number of circumcisions performed. Currently, no state or federal laws single out male circumcision for regulation. The tolerant attitudes toward male circumcision in law, medicine, and societal opinion stand in striking contrast to the attitudes of those disciplines toward even the least invasive form of female genital alteration. US law tacitly condones male circumcision by providing exemptions that are not available for other medical procedures, while criminalizing any similar or even less extensive procedure on females. The increase in immigration, over the past few decades, of people from countries in which female genital alteration is a cultural tradition has brought the issue to the United States. The medical profession's changing approach over time toward male circumcision is primarily responsible for such different legal and societal reactions toward female genital alteration.

 == Vietnamese language == 

 You should distinguish between the modern Vietnamese language as spoken by Vietnamese people and Sino-Vietnamese.  For about a thousand years, Vietnam was under the domination of China.  While the people spoke Vietnamese, the written language was actually classical Chinese.  This classical Chinese writing can also be understood by the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese.  However, this written Chinese is not Vietnamese, and ordinary Vietnamese people had to learn it like they would any other foreign language.  When read aloud in Vietnamese, it sounds like gibberish.  While much of the Vietnamese vocabulary are borrowed from Chinese  (see the Sino-Vietnamese article), Vietnamese has a different syntax from Chinese.   Consider French and English.  While English borrowed a great deal of its vocabulary from French, you can't assume that they have the same syntax and translate """"white horse"""" word-by-word into French as """"blanc cheval"""".  However, like the existence of French phrases in English, some Chinese phrases are also seen in Vietnamese.   

 After quoc ngu is adopted, there is no reason for Vietnamese people to write like the Chinese.  Written Vietnamese, unlike classical Chinese, is a transcription of what is said, thus when spoken aloud, it is perfectly understandable.  Classical Chinese are not understandable when spoken aloud, it wasn't until the advent of vernacular Chinese in the early 20th century when that is possible in Chinese.  By that time, Vietnam had long abandoned Chinese.  """,518,0.099255726,0.006134271,0.08527042,0.0027989326,0.060777698,0.02320304

 == Wikipedia Reference desks == 

 Hello Aspro. On 11 July you replied to a question asked at Wikipedia:Reference desk/Science. The question related to Airliner cabin air. See your diff. Your answer included the following statements: 

 :The banning of smoking also meant that the amount new air added to the cabin could be reduced -thus saving the costs of pressurizing greater amounts of air to keep the interior atmosphere agreeable. To save more costs, they also reduced (in the last decade), the cabin pressure – but to the detriment of passengers suffering from emphysema and other medical conditions that low air pressure can aggravate. To counter the possible resulting in-flight emergencies from this new practice, some air-lines are now carrying portable automatic heart defibrillators on board. 

 To support your answers you supplied a link to a website that discusses spraying of insecticides on airliners. I have looked at that website but found nothing to support the statements I have pasted above. 

 I have also looked at the Wikipedia article on Cabin pressurization but I found no information of the kind you gave in your answer. It looks to me like you have used the opportunity given by this question to respond with some of  your original research. It looks to me very much like your own conspiracy theory, or someone else’s conspiracy theory to which you have enthusiastically subscribed. 

 Wikipedia’s reference desks are intended as places where Users from around the world can ask serious questions and receive high-quality answers. I think your answer was a very poor one so I ask that, in future, if you can’t find the answer using the resources of Wikipedia or some other reliable published source, don’t answer the question. Certainly don’t use the reference desks as vehicles for your own original research or your favourite conspiracy theory.

Improvement can only come when legitimate criticism is permitted and addressed. Paswan's party's name is ridiculously redundant; likewise with the other parties, the names of which I had provided translations for. This needs to be brought home to them, and I was doing it in a way that was not insulting, though mocking. Secondly, there is a tendency for politicians to secede and erect one man parties at the drop of the hat, which seem to be harking back to the feudalist phenomena of strong individuals setting themselves up as """"barons"""" and """"nobles"""" (""""Sardars"""" in Indian history), and this tendency must be checked; ridicule is the best means to this end, the ridicule of nonsensical variations of party names, that often are nothing but emply slogans masking egoist ambitions. Politics in India needs to be encouraged to coalesce into a smaller number of better-organized parties, and that can be done only by discouraging fissiparous and individualist tendencies.

 Second, is """"St Michael%92s"""" really the proper name?  I would have thought that an apostrophe (') should be used between """"Michael"""" and """"s"""", not the single quote. 

    

  
 An increase in the transiant nature of the asian population has led to a sharp increase of intakes from """"off shore"""" that is students who may or may not understant the language and philosophical beliefs system of australia. The school encorages this through higher costings for those from asia and encoragment in the form of an """"expensive western education"""" many of these students do well, and thus become the much needed statistics for the school however they are mearly a number, not a member., (author reserves the rights this is an opinion expressed by person with experience and not some one being payed thsu not propaganda)

 It would not appear that a mockery is being made, it appears as if you are merely trying to censor some of the more 'colourful' aspects of the community which do not match up with their prescribed marketing drivel. 

 == Disputed == 

 There are a number of statements in this article that are not fact, rather students toying around. 

 Said statements have had dubious added at their conclusion. 

 > and who but the students are more qualified to add components to the article?  the function of wikipedia is for real - and possibly unconventional - knowledge to be documented, regardless of whether this is towing the party line or not.  the article is evidently neutral, even though certain aspects of the piece may not totally conform to the normal template of a wikipedia school's entry (ie marketing piece)- surely this kind of article is more in keeping with the original premise behind the site, as opposed to an advertising feature?

 Point 3: Do you deny that St Michael's has been compared to footscray secondary, by way of that appearence on George Negus tonight some time ago, where it was contended that footscray secondary does NOT have a pool. 

 Point 4: Do you deny that a few years ago there infact WAS a drug scandal at the school? (if you are one of the many new faculty intakes we can forgive you for not knowing as it was before your tenure) 

 Point 5: Do you deny that there are a number of students who have unofficially dubbed the schools slogan as """"diversity opens wallets""""

 * Please re-work all said statements to be far less deflamatory, abusive, vulgar, and childish. Ensure an end to Patent nonsense   please provide examples of #2

 == Aristotle's nationality inadequately adressed == 

 After reading the article on Aristotle and reading some archival material regarding Aristotle's nationality, I have concluded that no one (including moderators) have sufficiently answered this issue: Was Aristotle Greek or Macedonian? Moderators tend to simply shut down other individuals arguments one way or another, but make no sufficient conclusion. Thus, I present to you some of the information which should be adressed in order to pursue a more accurate conclusion of Aristotle's origin. 

 According to the Penguin Books Classics publisher's historical biography of Aristotle in several of their (current) published Aristotle texts, Aristotle is designated as being Macedonian - not Greek - due to the (supposed) facts that: 1. he never spoke Greek since the current form of the Greek language was undeveloped. Rather, he spoke a tribal language of Vlach origin 2. While some simplistic historic accounts render ancient Macedonia as a Greek city-state, more accurate accounts reveal that Macedonia was considered by the Greeks to be a barbaric savage-land 3. Aristotle was chased out of Athens due to his Macedonian origins by an anti-Macedonian mob. This forced Aristotle to live out the remainder of his life in exile. 4. Macedonians were originally of Vlach, Trachi and Illiri (in addition to 4 or 5 other tribes, I cannot recall the names) tribe origins. In later centuries, slavic people began moving to Macedonia, however, there still exists a genetic connection between many contemporary Macedonians and the original 7 or 8 tribes. Aristotle supposedly had Vlach and Illiri descendants, accounting for the fact that he spoke a non-Greek language. 

 Keep in mind, that these are not my assertions, but rather, the assertions of a reliable publisher and source, Penguin Books. And if any moderators attempt to claim that this source is """"unreliable"""", I should like to remind them that Wikipedia has yet to have earned the recognition of being reliable. I would find it hard to believe that any adequately educated individual would not recognize the unreliability of Wikipedia. High schools and universities alike have restricted students from using Wikipedia due to its """"butchering of the nuance-related or obscure facts.""""

 == Authorized Committee above the logo, unattributed, unexplained, reads as promotion == 

 At the top of the info box is a bold """"Hillary for America"""". 

 What is this?  It looks like a campaign slogan.  Being bold, unattributed, above a campaign image, it seems to cross the WP:NOTADVOCACY line. 

 :Template:Infobox U.S. federal election campaign indicates that this field """"committee"""" is """"Name of campaign's authorized committee, as listed with the FEC. Drop candidate's first name, """"2008"""", or """"Inc.""""), if preferred."""" 

 OK.  So it may be the official name of the candidates """"authorize committee"""".  It begs the questions:  What is an """"authorized committee""""?  Is there a reference or further information for this """"Hillary for America"""" authorized committee. 

 The best I have found is """"Details for Committee ID  C00575795""""  found at http://www.fec.gov/fecviewer/CandidateCommitteeDetail.do 
 Data provided includes: 

 :ID 	 Name 	 Treasurer Name 	 Active Through 	 City 	 State 	 Party 	 Committee Type/Candidate Office 	 Committee Designation 
 :C00575795 	 Hillary For America 	 Jose H Villarreal 	 2015 	 New York 	 NY 	 Democratic Party 	 P - Presidential 	 P - Principal Campaign Committee Of A Candidate 

 Assuming this is correct, the bold, unattributed slogan at the top of the page above a campaign image still comes across as promotion.  I think Template:Infobox U.S. federal election campaign needs some editing for format and position of the """"committee"""" field, the authorized committee name should be defined as such, and the authorized committee name should be referenced.

 Oh right, I thought that was what you meant. With regards to the leadlerless organisations; SPEAK, SHAC, SARC, WARN, although they are leaderless resistance, they are official organisations so are both.

 == Serious Concerns About the Use of Sources == 

 Assuming this article will survive the current AfD, then serious scrutiny must be given to the use of all the sources Warden has added in his attempt to expand this page from a dictionary definition into a full article after he had the speedy delete reversed. The most conspicuously troubling is this verbage of Warden's: 
 :""""In selecting candidates for the NASA's scientist-astronaut program, the National Academy of Sciences said that perspicacity was the most important quality required(footnote)"""" 
 :Indented line 
 This is a distortion of the source. The source is one of the light, short general interest pieces Science publishes in its first few pages, before the peer-reviewed articles. It is dated October 7, 1966. The article never says that perspicacity was the most important quality required. The article quotes a recruitment brochure that uses the word """"perspicacity."""" To further show how dated this source is, the article states:  
 :""""Women scientists are not ineligible, but, as one NAS panel member put it, they have a strike against them. An astronaut's training is long and costly, he observed, and there will be 'no time off for having babies.'"""" 
 The training brochure's choice of the word """"perspicacity"""" is likely nothing more than an artifact of the general writing style at the time, a style that also included phrases like """"vim and vigor"""", even in cigarette ads. The words """"acumen"""" or """"discernment"""" might have just as easily been chosen by the copy writer, the article does nothing to establish """"perspicacity"""" as a notable concept. It seems Warden is just seeking out examples where the word was used in a sentence to pad the article, and his misuse of the above source is very troubling.

 ::The equipartition theorem says that at temperature T the energy of any quadratic degree of freedom is ½kT. So Uthermal = N f ½ k T, where N, is the number of molecules in the system and f is the degrees of freedom the molecule has. So, since a monatomic ideal gas has only three degrees of freedom (translational motion only) the thermal energy . A diatomic or triatomic molecule has more degrees of freedom (because of """"internal flexing"""") however you have to go into quantum physics to understand how to count degrees of freedom for molecules properly. At room temperature N2 and O2 has 5 degrees of freedom for example. —

 == Educated Horses """"Punk?"""" == 

 As a very longtime fan, I see a much bigger significance in Rob's career with Educated Horses than this article implies.  Although he had stated in various interviews that his intention was to essentially """"strip down"""" from the latex, make-up, and """"video game"""" performances, this latest release is not only an abandonment of his past image, it is completely devoid of his fusional mastery and trademark sensuality.   When I think of 'punk,' I think of Sex Pistols, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, or The Exploited.  These acts had passion and attitude, which """"Horses"""" has none.  Reviews have varied from the """"best thing he's ever done"""" to the downright cruel and scathing, which I will not repeat here. It feels more like a demo than a major release, which makes me wonder if the band shouldn't be performing under a formal name. 

 This """"strip down"""" has also dramatically affected his visual work as well.  """"Foxy, Foxy"""" is an amateurish effort to appeal to pubescent 12 year old boys with the visual stimulation of an onion  if you could see anything past the sun-glare in the cameras.  Now, if this is a taste of his visual work yet to come, we've got a whole new artist.  And in that case, maybe he should deliberate changing his name.

18874,1fc390d1de307af3,"""""""Falun Gong and self-immolation""""  an original synthesis== 
 This is just about the one section called """"Falun Gong and self-immolation"""", which AnnaInDC removed. This section is a piece of propaganda; in wikipedia it's called a """"Synthesis of published material that advances a position"""". The edict there is to """"not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources."""" and """"If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources."""" This section hovers between legitimate commentary and quotes, and synthesis/propaganda in its descriptions. I will write sentence by sentence, referring to the text. I thought it would be easier to present the sentence in italics first, then a starred remark. 

 Falun Gong stated that there had been no incidents of self-immolation among Falun Gong practitioners in the world before 23 January 2001. 
 *Neutral statement. 

 However, the China Association for Cultic Studies published details of 3 instances of Falun Gong followers who they claim committed self-immolation prior to 2001, the earliest one in 1997, and 3 further instances said to have taken place subsequent to the incident in Tiananmen Square. 
 *Propagandamaking this juxtaposition is not okay. It's not a reliable source to begin with, anyway. facts.org.cn is the CCP's very own attack web site. If you know Chinese, check the virulent original. Want to know more? Try searching """"凯风"""" """"610"""" site:gov.cn. It's a propaganda website which has no credentials to discuss Falun Gong. 

 Academics such as Chang (1991), Rahn (2001), Lindsey (2001) and Li Cheng (1997) recognised that suicide is a traditional gesture of protest in China; ter Haar (2001) postulated that former Buddhists may have brought with them the """"respectable Buddhist tradition of self-immolation as a sacrifice to the Buddha"""". 
 *Next it refers to academics who talk about suicide as """"a traditional gesture of protest in China"""" (no mention of Falun Gong?) and ter Haar who postulates that """"former Buddhists may have brought with them the """"respectable Buddhist tradition of self-immolation as a sacrifice to the Buddha"""".""""  this is also totally irrelevant. That link is dead now anyway so we can't check, but there's nothing here that indicates any relevance to Falun Gong, so it's all a subtle original synthesis. By referring to a """"traditional gesture of protest in China"""" and """"former Buddhists"""" etc., it kind of implicates Falun Gong without doing so explicitly. A form of original synthesis. 

 """"The Guardian commented that Li Hongzhi's new scripture released on 1 January 2001, Beyond the Limits of Forbearance, had confused his supporters. 
 *Next paragraph. I know Gittings is an old China hand. This could be attributed better though, and mentioned alongside other pertinent commentaries. These are cherry-picked opinions designed to give an impression, not a full representation of what commentators have said regarding whether it's likely they were practitioners or not. 

 Matthew Forney in Time magazine believed the message had spread into China via the internet and informal networks of followers, and reached more radical practitioners there. 
 *Forney in Time; this seems okay, but what it's building to and the context it's placed in make it problematic. 

 Falun Gong headquarters in New York admitted ten days after the release of the scripture that """"certain disciples had some extreme interpretations [and thought] we are going to resort to violence"""", and asserted that Li's message merely meant time had come to let the truth be known about China's atrocities. 
 *The """"headquarters"""" """"admitted"""" could be better attributed or ommited, since these aren't the terms used by the entity referred to. I would suggest that in this context, they are words to avoid, or weasely. If they don't add anything (do they?) then why not just say what the Falun Dafa Information Center said, rather than what Falun Gong """"headquarters"""" """"admitted""""? 

 Jensen and Weston remarked it was clear from Li Hongzhi's messages that he advocated martyrdom over prudence, and that """"if the Chinese authorities lit the fire, Li just as clearly fanned the flames.""""''

 == Darn good question == 

 I used the 88k for a """"high-powered"""" embedded system in the late 80s and I thought it was a really nice CPU, easy to design with, program for and easy to get good performance with minimal tweaking. At the time it had some very advanced concepts which made efficient pipelining a snap. 

 However, the multi-chip design of the 88100 (needed two MMUs and one CPU; remember, split I/D buses!) was a big turn-off in general, initial performance was disappointing, the separate MMU chips slowed things down even more, and it wasn't cheap. The 88110 was a major improvement in both speed and ease of use, but they were always behind in the CPU clock speed wars... and wasn't long after that PowerPC was announced. Combined with Sun's heroic efforts to spread the gospel of SPARC, the chip was doomed. A shame, but I think the answer is that just came out at exactly the wrong time. If the 88110 had been released in the late 80s, it probably would've caught on. 

 I believe Ford (yeah, the car people) also used it in a graphics workstation, but I may be misremembering. The 88k actually had special instructions for doing Gouraud shading calculations.""",898,0.09930158,0.0061511695,0.08524472,0.002799107,0.060728546,0.023260452

 == Suggesting information to add == 

 As you can see above, I work for ARI and it was based on discussion of my redirect request that this page has now been renamed to """"Autism Research Institute"""". Now that the page focuses on ARI, it seems like it would be helpful for there to be more information on what ARI actually is and does. Especially in the first line of the article, should this not be a description of what the organization is rather than stating something that it created?  

 Since it's best for me not to edit the article myself, here are a few initial suggestions for others to add. I've included links to sources to support each point: 

 *Autism Research Institute is a 501(c) organization focused on research to improve quality of life for adults and children with autism spectrum disorders. 

 *The organization was founded in 1967 by Bernard Rimland, PhD   

 *ARI collaborates with organizations including Autism Speaks to provide continuing education on adult support issues, though its Autistic Global Initiative.  

 *The organization has also collaborated with The Cleveland Clinic Center for Continuing Medical Education on autism spectrum disorders. 

 *Along with the Blazeman Foundation for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) research, ARI co-funds the National Institute of Childhood Health and Human Development's Brain and Tissue Bank at the University of Maryland School of Medicine

 :::::: Fordfox12/Ajaxfiore, it would be nice if your Mexican history professor can provide 2 things: 1) a reference to what exactly she is not fond of in regards to La Revista Academica's publication on Islam (was it because it explored potentially taboo topics like extremism and Islamic feminism?), 2)what exactly (in her opinion) would deem this publication 'non-academic'?  

 :::::: So the difference is that Eusebio registered himself as the child's father, and it is noteworthy that this occurred exactly during the culmination of the investigation of sexual abuse. Your grandmother, on the other hand, can claim you as her 'legal guardian', but she cannot register herself as your mother. There is a clear distinction because firstly, your grandmother did not register herself as anyone's birth mother, and secondly, I'm sure she was not being charged with rape (I pray to God she wasn't) during the time she claimed legal guardianship. 

 :::::: This is an excerpt from the article: """"Aarón Joaquín, eventually recognized the infant and registered him as his own son"""". I don't make any 'leaps' when I say Eusebio was illegally having sex with women other than his wife (specifically underage women). His admission of guilt for any wrongdoing is only compounded when he registered himself as the father. There are no false implications in what I just wrote, and if I make a mistake, however obvious it may be, I ensure to acknowledge it. But in this case, I made no leap.   

 :::::: Also, who says that a newspaper or two can't point to facts? You mean to say that you're against what academians use on a daily basis for their research?! So long as it's not a fictional tabloid, it's perfectly reliable. Keep in mind the painstaking work and oversight of researchers, writers, editors, senior producers, and other staff that goes into publishing every newspaper, journal, and book. In actuality you're confusing """"bias"""" for """"validity"""". Simply because a publisher focuses their work on taboo topics does not mean it is unreliable. As anthropologists, it is important to cover every aspect of their subject matter, regardless of how unacceptable their publication may sound to you or anybody else. 

 :::::: As for the Protocols of Elders of Zion, there's countless books that refute and prove the fraudulent nature of it. I do agree that ANY predisposed beliefs based on intolerance of others' race, religion, and beliefs, not just against Jews, but against all minorities, are false. 

 :::::: Now that we're on the topic of intolerance, this brings me nicely to my last point. It seems to me that you may be finding ways to discredit any claims made against the church founder because, frankly, I believe you to be a member of the church (which I frequently encounter on wiki lldm, but that's okay). This could potentially become a huge problem when you edit the controversy section because of the following: 

 :::::: The basis for your arguments against those updating and protecting the """"Controversy"""" section becomes flawed because any argument that is contrary to members of lldm's beliefs is """"intolerable"""" to you (to see what I'm referring to please read or google Genetic Fallacy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy ). Even the La Revista Academica is somehow distasteful to you. Thus your arguments become based on a discreet dislike of people who are not on your side of thought (just like Protocols of Elders of Zion was intolerant of Jews, you're now intolerant of scholars who want to give light to the personal lives of church leaders), and that becomes a catatlyst for you try to remove as much content from the controversy section (which is impossible by the way). Do you believe that Samuel Joaquin is the Apostle of God? ~V3ritas

 Space Science 30 major cutting-edge technology research and breakthroughs, the commercial value of hundreds of trillions and huge profits 

      21-22 century science and technology advances, brewing a major breakthrough in all areas. In the field of cutting-edge technology, aerospace engineering to bear the brunt, most important, led the way, an extremely important area for future development of human society. In a sense, it will completely change the rewrite human history and natural history of the universe. Particularly with regard to Mars landing, establishing a lunar base, the Moon of Earth, Mars, the planet of the countries in the world put a lot of manpower, material and financial resources to develop the breakthrough Figure in cosmic science. Mars landing probably need to invest billions of dollars to, or less, if the budget billions of dollars can also be piloted. Simple lunar base only about several hundred billion dollars to the initial shape. The large-scale transformation of the moon, Mars transform costly, it can not be said to astronomical, but it also needs tens of trillions of dollars. Save some estimates, at least invest between $ trillions and tens of trillions of dollars. Of course, technically feasible, the return naturally considerable, about investment profits worth hundreds of times, this is self-evident. Water temperature, air is the most important prerequisite for the existence of life. Planet trillions of kilometers away, rather than the Earth, very, difficult to imagine in the north and south. The most critical scientific research is Earth, the Moon, Mars or other planets countless whether absolute 'homogeneity', or 'heterogeneity', which is the major issue of great concern to scientists. 

  

 Space science and technology major cutting-edge technology are many, but the most important to solve the most urgent of the most critical include the following 30 top cutting-edge technology. The following are described as follows: """"design, drawings, patents, know-how, formulas, processes, materials, etc.). Aerospace science and technology, space technology high investment, high risk, therefore, very important systems integration technology, safe, reliable and feasible, low-cost, otherwise, even the best technical drawings also will become a dead letter, shelved, it is the success of R & D The key lies. Thus, R & D 30 cutting-edge technology can be streamlined to save, for example, simulation, simulation, simulation design, simulation, design, and so on, with high high high intelligence capability means a significant reduction in a variety of research costs. For example, the spacecraft design, spacecraft dynamic design, automatic control, new materials, Mars geology, etc., greatly reducing the development costs. 

  
 Mainly to solve the major cutting-edge technology, including (1) the planet water synthesis. Regardless of the moon or Mars, water is undoubtedly the source of life. Overcome difficulties water is primary sophisticated high-end technology. Water Planet manufacture of synthetic technology. As long as this technology breakthrough, it means that the human world greatest success. Of course, there are in-depth exploration and mining of groundwater resources of the planet, there may be possibilities. (2) Preparation of air oxygen composite technology. This is not very difficult. (3) temperature, energy technologies. This technique has difficulty factor, but not very obvious. (4). Speeding spaceship energy technology. The new spacecraft. (5). A full life support systems technology. (6). Biosystems survival techniques. (7). Cosmic radiation radiation technology and specialty materials. Special space suits. This technique also requires breakthroughs. (7) Space inst",996,0.10002504,0.00612882,0.085330546,0.002802259,0.06074385,0.023352329
