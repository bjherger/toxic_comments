You pretend that no one doubts that a Marlowe-Shakespeare influence exists, but the childishly phrased third paragraph of the page lede states that they have completely different styles and world views. I presume you, or someone as mindless, jumped to that conclusion. You don't deal with Bloom's honest concerns about a major scholar like himself being forced to jump through hoops to invent an apprenticeship and a possible appearance by WS at a Marlowe play. If they were in London writing at the same time for rival theatres, it's ridiculous that they would not have met, or that they never indicated that they had. The point is that they didn't. There was no apprenticeship or meeting of minds because Shakespeare did not exist in any documented way as a writer before Marlowe died. Perhaps he never existed in London at all. He was a Stratfordian usurer, if he was anything, whose name was used as a pen-name, as Mark Twain sarcastically pointed out long ago. If you don't appreciate Stoppard's wrong-headed conclusions, neither do I, but at least he's a dramatist. Why cite Mortimer and other old fogies? There are major omissions in Marlovian theory as it sits, and addressing it is central to the debate. What's also central to the debate is the morbid brutalising, and I say again, bowdlerising, of the undoers and conservative gravediggers like yourself, little Englanders who cannot accept that the Bard never wrote a line. If you can't accept that this enormous literary black hole is as warped a paradigm as geocentrism, you might as well get a job for the Stratford tourist trust.  vpcj

 In response to Runch, I have looked about a great deal, and have followed what is seen of GRRM's page, Erickson's page, ASOFAI page as well. If you wish to remove such information on their pages then do so, but you will find that everything I have added is in like manor the same material on other pages. 

 Simply because someone doesn't feel something fits doesn't mean it isn't pertinent or germane. I have sourced the material, I have placed it accordingly as it fits to the knowledge and understanding of this page. 

 As I've said in the past, Wikipedia is an OPEN format and is also so stated that editing will be done. I have acted in good faith and have place appropriate and good solid information. I'm simply adding appropriate content. The fact that someone doesn’t wish for Goodkind to look good or be place in a positive light is not my problem. What is my concern is adding the proper spin and pertinent info!

 ::Hi Again. You said: """"Kurdish is grammatically closer to altaic-languages like Turkish."""".  That is not true at all and it is classified under Iranian language and some versions of it are very close to Persian (Kalhori, Feyli).  Also Arranian language was not Khazarian and Muqaddesi actually calls the language of Azerbaijan (part of the 8th region) as Persian.  Soo does Masudi.  So does Ibn Hawqal.  There is not a single reference that Khazar was spoken in Aran.  Baluchs are not Turkich tribe and Masudi got it wrong in this case.  Their nomadic lifestyle might have lead to confuse it , or it was a manuscriptal era, or perhaps you are quoting it wrong.   There was some Khazar officers(originally slaves) in Baghdad (like Boga) but they were sent from Baghdad and originally they were not from below the caucus.  These were originally Jewish but were converted when they were sent and raised in Baghdad.  Anyhow, there are too many issues that can be discussed, but the important issue is to bring valid English sources (not translations)(with proper citation) or actual original (Arabic, Persian) (not through an intermediatory source).

[...] I saw Iron Man as not just a superhero in a suit; rather he is a pilot or weapon. To me, the Iron Man armor is more akin to a jetfighter than it is to an outfit. 

 Look how ugly that is! And it's all the fault of those ellipses within brackets.

 == Inconsistent use of % GDP to refer to """"records"""" == 

 From the Article: 

 Statement 1: """" had reduced total federal revenue, as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product, to the lowest level since 1959."""" 

 Statement 2: """"The annual deficit reached record levels of $374 billion in 2003 and $413 billion in 2004"""" 

 This is an obvious (at least to me as an accounting guy) POV violation.  Nominal numbers rarely tell the whole story in an economy we expect to grow over time.  Stating that annual deficits are records in nominal terms is misleading especially after referring to federal revenue as lowest since 1959 as a percent of GDP.  The author uses % GDP when it makes the President look bad and quickly abandons it when it would show non-record deficits as a percent of GDP.   

 I won't edit it, but I think a consensus can be reached on consistent use of nominal or percentage numbers when referring to the economy.  This should be at least one sticking point we can all (at least the level-headed among us) agree on. 

 Consistent use of statistical terms absolves you of charges of manipulating numbers. 

 Oops, Forgot to Sign,  5-31-05 

 In fact, I just read the reference to USAToday's pre-election article and it mentions this fact at the very end of it's article. 

 """"The administration and congressional Republicans say the most important measure of the deficit is that the 2004 shortfall was an estimated 3.6% the size of the economy. That is well below the worst-ever 6% figure set in 1983 under President Reagan.""""   

 (Strictly speaking it is the worst-ever Post-WWII.) 

 """"Many economists agree that such a comparison is more significant because it shows how affordable the deficit is for the nation. But many of them are uncomfortable with shortfalls of that size because deficits are expected to worsen later this decade when the huge baby boom generation begins drawing on Social Security and Medicare. """" 

 I'd like more comment on this before someone makes the change as it will get reverted by opponents anyways. 

  19:37 5-31-05 

 :I have no objection to including the information, but the term """"nominal"""" is uninformative and possibly confusing because of its colloquial use to mean """"small"""".  I think what you mean is to make clear that the Bush deficits are records when measured in current dollars, so that's what I've changed it to.  (I don't know how the Bush deficits compare with Reagan's in constant dollars, but it would be interesting to know.)  Also in that section, I've removed the unattributed POV that Bush's tax cuts helped curb the recession.   

 I think we are running at 3.6% whereas Reagan was in the neighborhood of 6% don't quote me.  Nominal just means the actual dollars as opposed to referencing a value in relation to something else ie GDP.  Nominal is an accounting term and is used correctly, if you use it to mean small that is incorrect, colloquially or not. 

 

 :I wasn't referring to percentage of GDP, but to the actual size of the deficit, adjusted for inflation.  Bush's deficits are bigger in current dollars but maybe not in constant dollars.  As to """"nominal"""", it may have a technical meaning in accounting and have a different, though still correct, meaning in other contexts.  Merriam-Webster online mentions """"trifling"""" and """"insignificant"""" as possible synonyms.  Anyway, whether that meaning is correct or not, we should try to avoid a term that many people will read that way.   

 :: Dsquared is correct, but I understand the confusion.  Nominal is one of those words that means what it sounds like: """"In name.""""  If you say """"Catholics have a nominal obligation to attend mass weekly"""" you may mean the obligation isn't actually significant, but you aren't saying the obligation is small (it's a big obligation that whose violation is condoned though not approved by the Church).  Hence, """"nominal GDP"""" is the GDP by name (number of dollars).",63,0.08545846,0.009259931,0.0350544,0.0017650333,0.02908751,0.005340973

 Zdravo ) Tih lista ima raznih, ja sam se najvise ugledao na francusku i italijansku jer kad sam poceo da editujem ova lista mi je bila prvi projekat i tada su mi editori tih dve listi pomogli. 

 Kapiram te probleme koje spominjes, i ja sam sam gledao uvek kako na najbolji nacin da ih resim. 

 Ogranicavanje liste na samo period od 2006 pa na sada je nesto sto bi najvise mrzeo. Nekako mi je taj nas fudbal uvek u kontinuitetu bio (isto drustvo, ista mafija, isti glavni klubovi, mnogi igraci, itd.). Meni je od pocetka bas bio cilj da lista bude infrmativna, posto kod nas ljudi iovako ne znaju za te strance, pa da znaju barem jos od pocetka fudbala kod nas pa do sada. Francuska i italijanska lista imaju sve te igrace jos os 20-tih i 30-tih itd. Nemacka nema jer se desila specificna stvar: Lattoufedisco je pravio polako tu listu u sandboxu  i pojavio se neki lik copy/pastevao je i napravio kao clanak, sa tim da je lista totalno inkompletna i u stvari pocinje od tog nekog perioda do koga je Lattoufedisco stigao dok je pravio ) ince ideja je da je kompletira ali nije jos stigao... 

 Iz te iste liste sam uzeo princip stavljanja sezona, a ne godina kao godina. Ako je igrac dosao kao Garido u sezoni 2012/13 te godine, odnosno sezona, treba da stoji. U sustini je bitnija sezona nego kalendarska godina. One zagradice za polusezone su mozda visak, to sam samo dodao da bi isprobao i ostavio... 

 To notes i additonal information moze kako god mislis. 

 Uglavnom ta lista i ona Jugoslovenska su mi najvaznija stvar na vikipediji, zbog njih sam i poceo da editujem vikipediju i njih jedino i popunjavam i radim cak i kad nemam vremena kao ovih zadnjih meseci...",71,0.085351594,0.009226568,0.034935094,0.0017588615,0.02912529,0.005304189

 Hi Jerem43. I've actually got the ingredients together and tried to make a squab pie. Well, actually I didn't have any flour to make pastry, so I created the pie base took the photo and changed it into a stew... So, we have an image on the page. It's not the best image, but it does illustrate the pie, and I'll be updating it when I get a new camera in a few months.

 * Evarose, allow me to add my voice to the throng; what you have here is a polemic essay, not a factual, neutral article.  Polemics are not permitted on Wikipedia, any more than in any other reputable encyclopedia.  You are, I believe, operating off of a premise often shared by newcomers to Wikipedia - that there must be some way, if we'd only help you navigate it, for your advocacy piece to pass muster.There isn't.  Take your Bruce Clark proposal for an example.  If you have the reliable sources to do so - an unpublished master's thesis doesn't remotely count - you can certainly write an article about Clark as a notable lawyer and activist on behalf of First Nations peoples, including such details as the notorious cases in which he was involved, his prison sentence and disbarment.  You cannot cast him as a noble crusader for downtrodden peoples, who proved to be the victim of smear and dirty tricks campaigns, driven into exile by a corrupt government.  As long as you are determined to write advocacy pieces, instead of neutral statements of verifiable fact backed by reliable, independent, third-party sources, then they will be subject to prompt deletion.No one is telling you, of course, that you can't write advocacy pieces.  We're just telling you that such pieces have no place on Wikipedia, and that you must seek other venues for their publication.

 == """"Shoot the Moon"""" == 

 In the liner\program notes of my local cable provider, in the """"Wyatt Earp"""" movie, the character(and therefore alluding to the actual historical person,) was said to be a """"Southern boy"""". However, the actual history is plainly seen that Wyatt and his family hail from the north (Illinois, later California, with Wyatt rambling about in Missouri, and Kansas). His brief troubles in Arkansas would harldly qualify him as a """"son-of-the-south"""", to say the least. The tag on the liner notes suggests that arguably the greatest """"cowboy"""" who never was can be claimed by """"Southern Revauchists"""" 

 Nothing is obviously further from the truth. Although most Hollywood films(and vintage dime-store novels) have been out right lies about Earp and his exploits and personal dealings, the Kevin Costner film ironically comes closer to the truth. Added to the fact the the ENTIRE EARP CLAN were fierce Lincolnite Republicans, fought for the Northern Union, and despised the southern, pro-slavery Democratic Party, of which the Earps' nemeses the Clantons, Mcclareys, and the cowboy\russler gangs belonged. 

 What's ironical in this is that the elongated bio-pic of Earp, gives a more accurate account of the wherefores and whyfors of Wyatt's personality and motivations(unlike the current trend of deconstructionism in most modern biographies in film and print). The curious """"public"""" reaction of disfavor in the iconic western hero presented as yet another pragmatic and woefully flawed H-U-M-A-N, is more likely limited to the cracker-minded mentality of those who would rather live and die by fantasy over historical veracity. Also the boiling-up of old hatreds between """"Yankees"""" and """"Rebels"""". (Of course it must be said that Hollywood had-as yet-an unexplained growing hatred towards Costner at about this time.) Wyatt can't be claimed by 'southern' romantics, not now, and of course, never. 

 The misleading liners on the cable program must be changed.

 ==Notability of National Campus and Community Radio Association== 
 A tag has been placed on National Campus and Community Radio Association, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable.  

 If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines. 

 For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

 I first tried simply giving the Factions section a small copyedit to make it smaller. But it still seemed rather unwieldly. The article guidelines state: 

 ::""""Articles on video games should give an encyclopedic overview of a game and its importance to the industry. Readers should be presented with a concise overview of the game's plot and gameplay. ... Because the encyclopedia will be read by gamers and non-gamers alike, it is important not to clutter an article with a detailed description of how to play it or an excessive amount of non-encyclopedic trivia. A general rule of thumb to follow if unsure: If the content only has value to people actually playing the game, it is unsuitable."""" 

 This makes it seem like a large section with faction descriptions is inappropriate. With that in mind I cut things dramatically. But maybe its too much? Let me know what you think, or if the Factions section just needs to be expanded a tiny bit from here. Maybe we can instead talk more about how factions relate to gameplay in the larger perspective or something.

 :I've read what might be done before an AfD, thanks. How long had the article already been tagged? How much time had already been wasted on discussion? Was it a hopeless case? I thought so and the page was getting worse because you and Piper were determined to use it as a platform for every possible statistic you could find supporting astrology (statistics which, interestingly, Chris has called dubious) and synthesizing them to produce OR. I misled no one. That's the last thing I'm going to say about this accusatory bullshit.   

 :Do I wish to categorize astrology under """"physical sciences, mathematics and medicine""""? I posted that because: 

 :a) I wanted to reiterate that our content policies rely on a scientific sources (again, as a methodology as much as a viewpoint) which you seem unable to accept.  

 :b) Insofar as this page makes any mathematical/statistical or physical science claims at all, scientific publications have primacy in how we cite, categorize etc. Put it this way: if we were to declaim any recourse to a scientific methodology for the astrology citations like the Mars effect and truly, actually, and only describe this as a faith, then the pseudoscience label would be unnecessary. But you can't have your cake and eat it: suggest that astrology may have a scientific basis on the one hand, and reject the majority scientific label on the other.  11:54""",175,0.08468078,0.009200515,0.03492792,0.001751061,0.028945273,0.005299728

 The term """"Energy crisis"""" was the only term used in print and broadcast media while the crisis was underway.  I have never seen the """"oil embargo crisis"""" term used anywhere up until your rename today. 

  01:48 5 Jul 2003 (UTC) 

 :I agree  

 ::I disagree with the move, while it was called this at the time there are many other energy crises that have occured, such as the one just recently in California, or the one a while back in eastern Russia.  There is also much information on impending energy crises.  This should either be where it was or perhaps at 1973 energy crisis or perhaps OPEC energy crisis.  01:59 5 Jul 2003 (UTC) 

 There is also an article on oil crisis.  It should be at something that distinguishes them, e.g. Energy crisis (1973) or Oil embargo (1973), since this refers to a particular event. It should be at something that distinguishes them, e.g. Energy crisis (1973) or Oil embargo (1973), since this refers to a particular event.  

 :Should there not be a general reference to Energy crisis, what is it.  Then more information on specific ones throught history and the world?  

 ::Sounds like an excellent idea, perhaps we should move the current contents of this page to a more specific title and then, for now, put a stub on general energy crises here.  04:06 5 Jul 2003 (UTC) 

 ::: sounds right, move this energy crisis to energy crisis (1973) or some such and then move text from oil crisis here and add some  

  
 The use of the term in 1973 and the following few years was ubiquitous.  I do not believe that there have been any other events where the term """"energy crisis"""" was applied contemporaneously in the news literature, or retrospectively in any well respected secondary sources.  For example, for the recent electricity kerfuffle in California, the term """"California electricity crisis"""" was most often used, with """"California energy crisis"""" and """"California electricity problem"""" also appearing; the term """"energy crisis"""" alone was not used without """"California"""" preceeding it. 

 As a compromise I would suggest Energy Crisis (1973) as a title if disambiguation is truly necessary; we could then have Energy Crisis (Russia) and whatever else.  However, there is no point in doing this until we actually have articles on other Energy Crisis topics (c.f. Wikipedia:Naming conventions. 

 Separately, the oil crisis article is poor as it contains errors of fact and omission, and is full of broad generalities that do not inform; the best portions of it should be merged with the energy crisis article and the rest binned.

 ==Move== 

 Seeing the discussion above and noting a recent comment at , I moved the page to 1973 world oil shock, which I've been wanting to do for a while. I would've chosen this title all along, but when I started editing this article, it was found at 1973 energy crisis. Please revert the move if there are any strong objections.   

 == Wikipedia as a source? == 

  - apparently Kenneth Pollack cites Wikipedia's article...I'm not sure I approve.    
 :It's pretty let's say """"interesting"""" to be cited by someone as prominent as Pollack for a donated article that I wrote with a pseudoanonymous account. I'm not sure how I feel about being caught up in what appears to be a horrible error of judgment, though... Wikipedia is a good way of sharing information; using it at your own risk, Wikpedia can lead you to other areas of inquiry and sources that are safe to cite. But I would not even use a Wikipedia article as a reference for a Wikipedia article; and I would not be too happy, to say the least, if I found, say, one of my students citing Wiki in a paper... He was probably getting lazy and did not bother to find another source using Google, let alone Lexis Nexis or JSTOR. It's pretty disappointing to see this from a serious commentator someone whom I would have likely cited myself before without much reservation.

107577,b384ef899f17a373,"What is written about Bio-resonance in the main Wiki Article is very basic and misses extremely important fundamental principles of bio-resonance and the mechanics of science it is based on, in fact there is nothing what so ever that even addresses this point, the only attempt to explain this is, Quote: Lacking any scientific explanation of how bioresonance therapy might work, researchers have classified bioresonance therapy as pseudoscience.[5] Scientific studies did not show effects above that of the placebo effect.[6][7] 

 Looking on a far larger scale, consider the HARRP Field in the perspective of scalar wave transmission, scalar proves that ELF can be manipulated that can effect the weather or other, military uses in targeting crowds with electromagnetic waves provoking disorientation etc.. 

 Bio-resonance is based on vibration, sequencing and scale harmonics, the ability to write algorithms of signature resonance expressing the actual vibration of a pathogen or microorganism, then using a filter, amplifying the vibration. This is many ways is no different than capturing sound waves is field geophysics using geophones and seismographs, the geophones are placed in an array pattern and the reflected sound is collected and processed simply because we have the controls in place. This does not differ from bio-resonance technology by the fact there are mathematical algorithms that have already been tested and the matrices are within the filter, the radio similarity or signature resonance is triggered through the sensor and placed within the filter to identify it's wave expression. 

 One extremely good testimony is my own, my son Oliver was 2 months old, he received the DPT 3 Vaccine at the hospital as standard protocol, that night at home he gained a fever and was extremely irritable, throughout the entire night we could not sleep, at 3:00 am we took him to the nursing station, the nurses on shift told us it was normal that he was having a reaction to the vaccine, there is nothing we can do and he will be fine. 

 The following morning a partner of mine brought a bio-resonance device to my house and scanned him, no electrodes, only a sensor, a 2 month old boy cannot speak, the way he communicated was with his discomfort. During the scan for the first time he feel to sleep almost immediately, after the scan was complete, we tested the program of Vaccines, the signal of the 3 components of the DPT3 were present, in Red indicating strong signals, if this is a hoax technology how can a device detect the exact vaccination that was injected into a 2 month old child be detected exactly, I did not tell my partner the name of the vaccines, but, the report of the scan told us, we used the invert control that inverts the wave pattern. He awoke within a few minutes, his fever was gone, he acted completely normal. My wife witnessed this with incredible surprise. This is a standard result with bio-resonance depending on the system, this particular system was Russian and does not utilize electrodes. There is far more to this than what the mainstream scientific or medical society give it credit, then again, Russians and Germans are far more advanced in certain areas.",223,0.08524653,0.009213957,0.035066105,0.0017522565,0.029013228,0.005321018

 I am requesting two change to this line: 'Despite his strong political opinions, Fiasco does not vote in U.S. elections nor does he involve himself in U.S. politics as he believes they are """"meaningless.""""' """"Despite"""" should be changed to """"In keeping with,"""" given Fiasco's clearly stated anti-establishment views. Also, the quotes around """"meaningless"""" should be removed: it's clear that he's not using the word ironically, nor is he referring to it.   

 As it stands, this sentence implies that Fiasco's views are contradictory, and seems editorial in putting quotes around """"meaningless."""" There is some implication that his abstinence from voting is in some way wrong or odd. If the intent is to quote him verbatim, limiting the quote to a single word doesn't seem the best way to do it. An alternative fix might be to give the entire sentence in which he calls voting meaningless.

 == Good Faith == 

 Shalom Loremaster, 

 This is a big thing to ask that I assume good faith regarding OvadYah. This editor has been quite deceptive during this enite debate. First he was attempting to pass as a NPOV a few archinved pages ago but I do not believe this can any longer be hid. 
 Look at the exchange that took place right before you asked me to assume """"good faith"""" were he states: 

 """"I have never heard of Shemayah Phillips claiming for himself more than the title of Paqid, which is basically a secretary or clerk. By contrast, the claims of your leader are exceedingly pretentious, and he was also excommunicated  from the Ebionite Jewish Community. I guess that's why you folks loathe Shemayah so much huh? 

 Given this statment what  would you understand it to mean? I went to his site and searched for the term """"Paqid"""" it says the term is irrelevent and it realy means """"President"""" not only that but this office of President can be handed down to sucsessors like a Monarchy. This offices makes him the desider of all things Ebionite[in his little world]. This sounds like a type of """"Priory of Sion"""" situation given Yeshua said to not even call another man teacher but all should be taught by the christ I.E. """"Anointing"""",which by the way has nothing to do with oil being poured on your head. 

 In the above statment he tries to minumize this and then call Allan my """"leader"""". All I can say is ive been in Allans fourms for over 3 years and hes never ordered anyone to do anything.  

 Then he says Allan was Excommunicated or some nonsence like that. Wouldnt you have to be converted before your excommunicated? If the EC will tell you of """"Ebionites proper"""" if asked regarding someones standing as thier President says at his site then they must have records of the rituals practised at converson like circumsision. I would LOVE to see reconds of that converson. This editor is relating the joining of a online fourm to being converted to thier religion.If you are kicked off the fourm your""""Excommunicated"""".

 == Note on 202.56.7.137 == 

 Your block is quite appropriate to hold off the vandal. Just wanted to tell you that the IP 202.56.7.137 is very likely to be the web proxy of Grameen Phone, the largest cell phone operator of Bangladesh. So, any long time block can affect a large number of unrelated users as well. The IP description says it is the IP of a """"router object"""". Not sure what that means ... but again, from the edit history, it doesn't seem to be a single editor. So, a 72 hour block may be too long. Thanks.    

 ==Help?== 
 Could you help revert the page of """"Arab Christians and Arabic-speaking Christians"""" to the last version restored by me? The previous version was a wholesale removal of researched content/section by a certain POV pusher whom I suspect was the mastermind of all those IP socks doing the same content blanking stunt over and over again. Thanks.

 we've flown on a plane

 but there was just one thing no one would tell us.... 
 SNAFU! What is the meaning of SNAFU? 
 What's it all about? 
 Can't figure it out!  
 Is it contagious? Or simply outrageous? 
 SNAFU! We hear it everywhere, SNAFU! 
 Is it like a pill? Or is it a thrill?  
 Is it a military secret? 
 We asked a looey* who at first was rather formal, 
 and then he laughed and shouted """"Situation normal!"""" 
 SNAFU! The greatest mystery in history! 
 Fun is fun, but why can't we find anyone 
 to spill the beans? 
 Tell us what SNAFU Means! 
 SNAFU! What is the meaning of SNAFU? 
 Is it something new that officers do? 
 Is it a dropkick?**  Or only a topkick?*** 
 SNAFU! We hear it everywhere, SNAFU! 
 Is it cold or hot? Inspected or not? 
 Is it a pot**** - of GI coffee? 
 We wrote a congressman for further information. 
 He said, “You'll have to start your own investigation!” 
 SNAFU! The greatest mystery in history! 
 Now, fun is fun, but why can't we find anyone 
 to spill the beans? 
 Tell us what SNAFU means! 

 Bud = Any guy (you could substitute “Pal” or “Friend” or “Joe”). 
 Chicks = Girls, women. 
 To go through the mill = To gain experience (usually not in a good way). 
 To spill the beans = To reveal a secret (sometimes accidentally). 
 Inspected or not? = I think this is a naughty reference to military VD (“short arm”) inspections. (VD = STD) 
 *looey = lieutenant 
 **dropkick = a move in football (but here I suspect it’s something else, maybe naughty) 
 ***topkick = sergeant 
 ****pot = toilet (probably) 
 GI = Government Issue = soldier(s’) 

 SNAFU, BTW, means """"Situation Normal, All Fucked Up!"""" 
 Its counterparts are TARFU (""""Things Are Really Fucked Up!"""") 
 and FUBAR (""""Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition!"""") 
 All of the above are WWII slang.

 == Sisters Upset Communion Being Turned into Political Issue == 

 Here is a statement from the website of the Sisters. 

 We can certainly now start to build this into the article.   

 Sisters Upset Communion Being Turned into Political Issue 

 """"We are dismayed that a moment of genuine communion during sacred worship is being twisted for political gain by the forces of hatred and dissension. — Sister Edith Myflesh, Current Abbess of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, Inc.  

 SAN FRANCISCO — On Sunday the 7th of October, the morning of the Castro Street Fair, two members of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence® attended Mass at Most Holy Redeemer Church. Most Holy Redeemer is located in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco and """"prides itself in being an inclusive Catholic community."""" The service was an opportunity to welcome the new Archbishop of San Francisco, Most Rev. George Niederauer. While at Mass the Sisters joined other parishioners in respectful and sincere worship and received Communion from the Archbishop. After the services, they stayed to socialize with the congregation before moving on to attend the Castro Street Fair. 

 Sadly, while the Sisters participated in the celebration, others not there to worship secretly filmed and photographed the Mass hoping to spark a controversy and cast the parishioners of Most Holy Redeemer and the Archbishop in a negative light. These professional muckrakers then gave the photos to an anti-gay Fundamentalist Catholic Website which in turn sent them to right-wing media outlets who willfully distorted the facts for political gain. 

 The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence are appalled that some media outlets have unwittingly spread these distortions while others have intentionally taken advantage to fuel a mean-spirited and divisive political agenda. These forces have been critical of Most Holy Redeemer for their welcoming approach to the diverse community they serve and have frequently seen fit to attack the parishioners as part of a larger campaign against """"San Francisco values."""" 

 Our hearts go out to the parishioners of Most Holy Redeemer and to the Archbishop who have been unfairly stigmatized by these disingenuous campaigns for doing nothing more than following the welcoming teachings of Christ and administering Communion in keeping with the teachings of the Second Vatican Council. 

 We would like to take this opportunity to state again that, contrary to the spin of right-wing fanatics, that the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence do not """"mock nuns"""" but live """"as nuns,"""" taking vows that affirm the traditional compassionate and justice-seeking ministries of religious women, extending their reach beyond the convent walls to those most in need. We are open and supportive of all forms of spirituality that teach respect for human life, diversity, freedom and community, including those of the Catholic Church. In fact, we have given several thousand dollars in grants to several religious-based organizations, including Most Holy Redeemer. 

 It is no secret that our vows sometimes call us to challenge the dogmas and hypocrisies of the Catholic hierarchy, in the same way they call us to confront politicians and even leaders within the queer community whenever they use their power and influence to promote fear, shame, division, and self-hatred. It is a bittersweet irony that these same forces of fear and shame now use the media to twist a moment of genuine communion into another justification for policies that harm people of faith and members of the LGBTQ community. 

 In keeping with our vows to expiate stigmatic guilt and promulgate universal joy, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence call on all people of good faith to oppose those who would desecrate the sanctity of a church and defile a moment of true communion for cheap political gain. In a world wracked by violence and fear, we have no time for such lies and will continue to serve our community by boldly proclaiming that joy is more powerful than shame. 

 We extend our sincerest gratitude and affection to the parishioners of Most Holy Redeemer and hope that their new Archbishop continues to walk with them in service to the gospel of joy and justice.""""http://www.thesisters.org/MHR_Release.html""",323,0.085116014,0.009169466,0.035072915,0.0017608535,0.028899364,0.005324803

 == this is dumb.... == 

 How can you reference something that is, and exists as """"is"""". The profanity is contained within the medium, it's not an opinion being expressed by a third party (an action that therefore requires a reference). You don't see calls for a reference that a Model T Ford has four wheels, or a dog has four legs!!! Why on earth do you need a reference to say whether a film is full of swear words? Just watch the movie and you'll know yourself! It seems there is an inane confusion between the whole meaning of what is verifiable facts and what is analysis/research/interpretaton. 

 Why can't I, as an example, get a movie from Blockbuster, watch it and then with my pad and pen count the number of fucks in it? Because it's original research, yes? Instead it takes another person with access to a computer to have their findings """"published"""" to make the fact a truth? This dichotomy is a serious error of how sources are meant to be used and applied. In this case, the primary source is the film, it should be good faith that merits inclusion i.e I watch Star Wars I see spacecraft, I watch Jaws and there is a big shark.  

 It amuses me so much to see think that - as this purports to be an encylcopedia - secondary sources are used as """"prima facie"""" evidence for the existence of primary evidence. This is akin to placing a published book on an Egyptian tomb's hieroglyphics in higher esteem than the real scripts. That's an utterly crazy situation. In the case of this film list, the movie is the source, so you don't need secondary sources to tell you if they say """"fuck"""" or not. Any one with any sense should start to see that this article highlights the ultimate limits to the whole Wikipedia project? Because selectively puts secondary and third party sources before primary evidence !! What a hoot. Using the same logic employed on this page, it would be original research to look at photograph of a human face and then claim all people have two eyes, because without a secondary source that would be Original Research!!!!!!!!

 First, the use of 'rebel' to decribe the native Irish does in fact imply that Irish resistance to English rule was unusual, was exceptional. The word in this context was designed to establish English rule as the norm in society. Ciarán Brady devotes some time to discussing this in his book on Shane O Neill/Seán an Díomais and points out that it was O Neill and his struggles which represented the norm in society and, if any group had been 'rebelling', it was the English government of Ireland which was rebelling against the norm. It is a thoughtless word for a professional historian to use; an acceptance of the English view of the time as fact. Second, because Irish-born worked in the English government doesn't make it less colonial, no more than Algerian-born Pied Noir working for the French made the French government in Algeria less colonial. In fact, native-born workers are part of every colonial government and all works on colonialism and settler-colonialism incorporate them into the structure of those types of government. Third, to claim that the government was 'Irish domestic' implies that domestic Irish concerns were at its heart. With just a flicker of thought towards the English attitude towards the Gaelic world, Ireland's majority culture, this is patently untrue. The refusal to allow even Irish-born Old English head the government confirms that in English eyes the nascent Old English community was not to be trusted in government (and they were not). It was a government which was fully controlled by the English, most especially from Sussex's deputyship, and to claim it was a 'domestic Irish' government is simply ahistorical. The resistance to English policies from 1556 to 1583, and the ultimate defeat of the Old English, confirms beyond doubt English colonial control over the government.",354,0.08531918,0.009231831,0.035142705,0.0017674993,0.029110223,0.005345867

 == Confusion over dates, 1840 or 1855? == 

 In the article on STV it states that the original concept was not used in a """"real election"""" until introduced in 1855 by Carl Andrae, a Danish politician. 

 Yet in another Wikipedia article on Thomas Wright Hill, it states that STV was used in an election in Adelaide, South Australia in 1840. Presumably this qualifies as a""""real election"""". If so,   there would appear to be some confusion over when STV was first used in a public election. 

 Here is the exact quotation from the article on Thomas Wright Hill. 

 """"Thomas Wright Hill (24 April 1763 in Kidderminster – 13 June 1851 in Tottenham) was a mathematician and schoolmaster. He is credited as inventing the single transferable vote in 1819. His son, Rowland Hill, famous as the originator of the modern postal system, introduced STV in 1840 into the world's first public election, for the Adelaide City Council, in which the principle of proportional representation was applied.""""

 == Infobox NFL player discussion: Thank you == 

 Batard, thank you for taking the time to organize the infobox template discussion on the WP:NFL talk page.  This is exactly what WP:NFL needs to make informed decisions, and exactly the sort of discussion that should have been prompted before the problematic TfD was initiated.  From the perspective of someone who is only an irregular participant at the TfD discussion page, this does not strike me as an unusual occurrence.  There is an inherent bias among the TfD regulars to merge, consolidate and delete by creating one-size-fits-all templates.  For many of them this is simply a coding exercise, with very little consideration of the resulting work and potential chaos that these consolidations cause as a practical matter.  Moreover, the consolidated all-purpose templates often become large, unwieldy and are sometimes not as easy to use as templates with more specific purposes.  In my personal experience, the unused and inappropriate parameters on the more complex consolidated templates sometimes invite vandalism and editor disputes over what are appropriate parameters to be used.  Rookies often want to fill every blank parameter, and vandals see blank parameters as an invitation to insert something """"funny.""""

 :Try clicking on the Whois link at the bottom of an IP user's talk page  that tells you the ISP. Then click on the traceroute link. The traceroute results show the route a packet takes to the customer; while you can't decode all the results, you can usually get useful info you can interpret: 
 :*   •  • [/wiki/Special:Log/move?user= page moves] • block user • [/wiki/Special:Log/block?page=User: block log]): 
 :**hop 10 is the last hop with an identifiable location: gbr1-p70.dlstx.ip.att.net.  I figure that's Dallas, TX. The subsequent hops don't have geographic locations, but you can figure this person is in the Dallas region. 
 :**hop14 shows: 24-116-127-234.cpe.cableone.net. A quick trip to the cableone.net web site, http://www.cableone.net/about/locations.asp?STATE=TX, shows the company's Texas locations 
 :**Hop 14 + whois both confirm this is a cable modem customer. Those are not shared IPs (unless a neighbor's surfing on the subscriber's unsecured home Wi-fi!) 
 :*   •  • [/wiki/Special:Log/move?user= page moves] • block user • [/wiki/Special:Log/block?page=User: block log]): 
 :**Traceroute hop 13 was as far as the pings got before hitting a firewall  probably the user's.  """"p9-0.dsl-06.dllstx.verizon-gni.net."""" can be interpreted to mean a DSL user in Verizon's Dallas region 
 :**Whois confirms it's a Verizon customer.  
 :**DSL accounts, like cable modem accounts, are almost never shared. 
 :Traceroute and whois data requires some interpretation and common sense. For instance, some Verizon IP addresses are still registered to GTE, Nynex or Bell Atlantic, 3 predecessor companies merged to form Verizon years ago. Another example: frequently the last 5 to 10 traceroute hops for some ISPs pass through hops with gobbledy-gook nomenclature you can't get a location out of. Some companies may mean a very narrow area in Dallas proper when they use dlstx; others may mean Texas + surrounding states. I've never seen that there's any standard nomenclature ISPs use when responding to traceroute pings; one may use dlstx, another rcntx (Richardson, a suburb), another dfw-1, still another wyqz for the same town. Just the same, common sense will get you far enough to figure out what you need to know. 

 :We already know this is almost certainly the webmaster for searchtexoma.com. Since their web site says they're based in Denison, Texas, about 65 miles northeast of Dallas, these results are no surprise. Had you seen, however, that the new IP address was in Singapore, or even just Atlanta, you'd want to check out the possibility it was an open proxy using a tool such as Completewhois. (Neither's an open proxy  I already checked).

 == Request to reconsider deletion of the Hemobag == 

 Hi, W. Marsh, 

 You deleted The Hemobag but I have permission from the company to create the wikipedia entry (let me know what proof of permission that you need).  

 Although the Hemobag is a commercial product, it is legitimately one of about 3 ways to process and transfuse a patient's own autologous blood during surgery. Moreover, the article is loaded with valuable background information on blood salvaging and educational references on """"bloodless surgery"""" and bloodless surgey websites and also takes a neutral point of view on the product. 

 I note that wikipedia has other entires on blood salvage companies, most notably [Haemonetics]: 
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemonetics 
 They have a company entry with none of the educational material that I used in the Hemobag entry. Seems weird to me! 

 Please reconsider deletion of the Hemobag or let me know what I can do to make it acdceptable. Many thanks.

 ::In all honesty, I have to say that I quite agree with what this person has posted.  In nearly every single episode of Raymond it shows Debra literally hitting Raymond, because of certain comments he makes, or something he doesn't do right.

In all honesty, I find it rather amusing that you are now starting to change your argument because someone has brought to everyone's attention about the abuse this show is showing towards men.  From what this person has provided with sources is good enough to convince any amid reader that it is indeed true.  Debra was borderline abusive in the sitcom.  Anyone with eyes could see that.  It wasn't hard to figure out that Raymond was scared of his wife because of how she treated him.  I can provide plenty of areas where Debra has been abusive to Ray, either psychically or mentally.  Before I provide sources, Debra's way of showing Ray in return of how she loves him, is by being physically, mentally and emotionally abusive to him.

Because before the archival revolution in 1990s much more data become available for the USSR. Scholars re-considered their early high estimates, because they have now more or less reliable numbers (that, btw, can be cross-validated by comparison different data sets, central and local archives, etc) However, Rummel (who was active mostly before this date) refuses to reconsider his early theories (although even such a hawk as Conquest partially reconsidered his earlier views).

Robert Conquest's The Great Terror had concluded with an estimate of twenty million deaths resulting from Stalin's rule (the Conquest's earlier estimate- PS), including the famine; Werth gives us considerably fewer.

 == Article ownership == 

 Vegavairbob, It looks as if you're having some difficulty understanding how editors work coöperatively to improve articles. Editors may, at their own option, confine themselves to particular kinds of edits. Some editors, for example, go around fixing punctuation errors or reformatting improperly-configured references. But no editor has the right or authority to dictate how other editors may and may not contribute to an article. When an editor fixes ungrammatical or awkward wording, or helps move an article towards encyclopædic tone is not a matter of switching to words that editor happens to prefer. It's a matter of article improvement. I would ask—again—that you take a very hard look at your behaviour with respect to WP:OWN, for your persistent, overt ownership of this article is reaching a level at which I will soon feel I have no choice but to request scrutiny of your actions. — ·""",778,0.08509852,0.008967799,0.034795053,0.0016986544,0.028983226,0.005162958

 ==Origin== 

  
 The name Vanniyar is derived from the Tamil word Vanni which means fire or Agni in Sanskrit. It also means Valour or Strength. They were originally known as Pallis in South India to called as Padaiyachis. The word Palli means """"village"""". Padaiyachi means """"commandant of the group or army""""  

 At Sirkazhi Vaideeswaran Temple, Inscriptions about Vanniyar Puranam are observed. It denotes that at ancient times there were two Asuras known as Vatapi and Mahi, who worshipped Brahma and obtained immunity from death and subsequently they garrisoned the Earth. At the request of Gods and Lords, Jambuva Mahamuni or Sambu/Jambu Maharishi performed a Yagam, or sacrifice by his yogic powers. Soon armed horsemen sprung from the flames, named VanniRaya; they undertook twelve expeditions and destroyed the Asuras and freed the Earth. Their leader then assumed the government of the country under the name Rudra Vanniya Maharaja or Veera Vanniyan, who had five sons,the Ancestors of Vanniyar Caste. This Tradition alludes to the destruction of the city of Vatapi by Narasimhavarman, the King of Pallis or Pallavas. 

 ==Historical References== 
 The Vanniar caste has close to 92 subcastes among them. The titles are awarded to them based on their contribution to the society. The Titles,"""" Indicating Authority, Bravery and Superiority,"""" assumed by them are Padaiyachi (Head of an Army), Goundan/Gounder, Naicker/Nayakar, Kandar, Sambuvarayas, Kadavarayas, Kalingarayas, Mazhavarayas, Samattiyars, Udaiyars, Varma, Kondiyars, Nainars, Sozhaganars, Munaiarayas and Kachirayas to name a few. Some say that they belong to Chennai and as such, they should be called as Chembians and the caste history is well known from the Mahabhartha epic at the moment of the birth of Draupathi from Agni kunda. 

 ==Caste titles== 
 The Vanniyars are officially classed belonging to Vanniakula Kshatriya caste in Tamil Nadu [1]. Depending upon the location and status, the members of the Vanniyar caste use titles such as Padayatchi, Gounder, Naicker or Nayagar, Reddiar, Kander/Kandar, Palli and many other titles in Tamil Nadu, Vanniar Gounder, Reddiar,Padayatchi etc in pondicherry, in Karnataka they are called Tigala / Thigala, or Thigilaru with a common suffix of Gowda, Hebbar or Hebbe and Nayakar. In Andhra Pradesh, Vanniars are usually known as Palli, Agnikula Kshatriya, Vanniyakula Kshatriya, Vanne Kapu or Vanne Reddy. In Kerala, they are called Vaniya pillai, Vaniya nair and Reddiar. There are 92 different names or sub caste/sub titles given for Vannia Kula Kshatriya community.

 The Vanniyar caste live in an area where three South Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra and Karnataka intersects. In these latter two Indian states they are in sizeable mass primarily due to migration of other sects from outside and vice versa. In Tamil Nadu, the Vanniar live predominantly in the north, east, central and parts of north western. These areas cover more than 13 districts and traditionaly called as the Vanniar Belt. It comprises the following districts in Tamilnadu: Chennai, Kancheepuram, Villupuram, Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, northern Thanjavur, Ariyalur, Perambalur, northern Trichy, Tiruvallur, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Salem, parts of Namakkal and northern Erode.

 :Kitty, you should read the prior Talk page posts, because your objections have been addressed (some of them repeatedly). The change isn't my personal opinion. Rather, I'm drawing the well-established policy on national varieties of English; and I addressed the four guidelines of the policy in the first comment here. You state that every person knows the word """"presents"""" in the context of the host of a news program. That is incorrect. As I noted more than once above, Americans don't use the verb """"present"""" to describe what a news anchor does. I didn't know the word was used in such a way until I started using Wikipedia. Americans may think someone who presents is the producer or a commercial sponsor. Either word might confuse some people. So the English variety settles the matter. American English is the proper variety. It was the first variety used and consistency should be maintained throughout the article. Melissa Lee is a U.S. citizen, born in New York state in the U.S. She resides in the U.S., works in the U.S., and is employed by a U.S. news channel. The article is considered a U.S. topic under the policy that uses the American variety of English. It is claimed that whether the word is a noun or a verb is significant. It's not. The articles that use anchor as a noun, also use it as a verb (e.g. Connie Chung) because they're from the same national variety of English. And presenter and present for news hosts are paired up in the same varieties of English. There is consensus across Wikipedia to use """"anchor"""" in such situations. One relatively new IP editor stirred up the situation in this relatively obscure article. What happens here doesn't trump the community-wide consensus. If you don't like the result here, you ought to seek to change the WP:ENGVAR policy or change the policy for all anchor articles at WP:JOURN rather than imposing an idiosyncratic result on this one page. Calling me a liar, a bigot, and a cultural imperialist violates civility policy. Those are unfair and incorrect accusations. Please familiarize yourself on personal attacks. Talk about the article's content rather than insulting people. American English deserves to be treated consistently with other national varieties on English; it should not be relegated to an inferior position.

 As I said in the Talk page I had removed the section for now - meaning I sat it to the side to open a debate on it.  Perhaps I should have have opened the debate on it first rather than remove it, as I still believe it rather irrelevant for the article.  And at that it was poorly written with only a small amount of trivial detail rather than a full explanation of what the situation was (sympathy walk out rather than BA dispute).  That's neither here nor there, however, as it could and was easliy brought back and I'm happy if that's what everyone else thinks.  But must you be so aggressive in your tone??  I was simply setting out my point of view, using language where I could to state what I thought rather than being dictatorial.

 == Taxobox removal == 

 I removed the taxobox. The article seems to be about a common name that refers to most (or all) species of two cetacean families.   

 :This was reverted here, with the edit summary Revert - information in infobox takes this into account, provides useful information. Dolphin is a common name for some species of the two families, not a single scientific taxon. The article explains this fact, I would not remove """"useful information"""". The specious inclusion is very misleading, it is best explained in the article. What reliable source would state it refers to these two taxa, when some of them have the common name of whale? Why should the taxobox be used for an article about a non systematic name?   

 ::I wouldn't  have a problem with having two families in the taxobox, except that under current taxonomy this one is now incorrect.  I am not concerned about the fact that some dolphins have a common name of """"whale"""", since most authoritative sources would recognize those species dolphin species despite the common name, since all are in Delphinidae.  But the problem is that the River Dolphins have now been split into multiple families, so just using """"Delphinidae and Platanistoidea"""" is no longer correct.  And rather than include five families in the taxobox, which becomes somewhat spurious, it seems better to remove the taxobox and discuss the taxonomy in the article.    

 :::What if the family section is just left out? Or be given a note like """"See article""""? I like the infobox and it does provide useful data and a basic glance at where dolphins fit in in the animal kingdom (it never fails to amaze me how many people do not seem to realise dolphins are mammals!). Looking at some other articles, there's no consensus on the infobox usage. The whale article has no infobox for example, while many others such as the shark, lizard or turtle articles do have them.    

 ::I have a problem with original research being used in our document. This would include basing a taxon on a common name, there is no concordance between common names and biological nomenclature. A reader comes here to acquire facts, those few who do not know they are mammals can gain that information from the content proper of the article. The two families, or even five, are not given an accepted taxon; the fact that some reliable sources (also!) name some of the species as Dolphins is incidental, not authoritative. Everyone likes the taxobox, let us be careful with our names here most of all, it is not an infobox. I appreciate that the undue weight given to other names appended to the correct name may cause this misapprehension, but the consensus is that a taxobox should summarise a single taxon and be included in only one article. Whale is without one for reasons that are intimately linked with this article's title. The other examples you have given are [hopefully] given in RS that state, unequivocally, a common name refers to a taxon: """"Sharks (superorder Selachimorpha)""""; """"Lizards (Suborder: Lacertilia) are a very large and widespread group of reptiles of the order Squamata"""" [highly debatable, but still a single taxon]; and superorder Chelonia (turtles) is yet another reptilian (Sauropsida) example that needed resolving. Removing duplicated or specious (spurious) taxoboxes is never popular with those who had a notion to include them, I'm not sure why, but it is certain to be the right path for clarifying explanations to our dear readers. An article on the common name 'dolphin' is justified, it could be more than a dab, but it is not a taxon. Please undo the unfounded revert of my edit.   

 :::All dolphins belong to the suborder of Odontoceti, every animal mentioned in this article does, so the taxobox """"tree"""" is correct (especially considering my last edit) - so no incorrect data is given in the box. I don't feel the definition of a dolphin as used in this article is based on original research, but is what is quite commonly accepted as what animals are covered under the word dolphin.

 ::I might actually have to offer a word or two for Urthogie here.  While I haven't compared the full extent of the changes, I think his effort to better organize the article actually makes some sense, disagreements notwithstanding.  Looking at the version before, for instance, one serious problem is the huge reliance on quotes, and beyond that, quotes which offered almost nothing in the way of explanation.  If you look at the old """"Use of the term"""" section, specifically, the explanation really stopped with Adam and Moodley, then proceeding into a quote farm of people making the allegation.  We then had an explicit list of the same kinds of quotes, apparently by more prominent individuals though not clarifying this. We then had a section on the UN, slightly out of place, followed by the long section on people lambasting use of the term, again without really any explanation.  Only after all that did we actually have an explanation of what all these people are talking about.   

 ::Urthogie's version, while quickly done, actually seems to solve much of this, by splitting it up into three ways in which the allegation is used, so that we can actually have some context and explanation.  Already this division is contextual information the other didn't provide.  He then provides the quote list, but followed directly by a discussion of the conditions.  At least on a surface level, this seems to make sense.  Perhaps partially as a result, he's also then trimmed up the """"Use of the Term"""" section to remove what were really just examples, to something that could be built into a more encyclopedic explanation (possibly using the rest of Adam and Moodley). 

 ::In any case, that's not to say I agree with all of the changes.  For one thing, I'm not sure the """"Allegations that Israel is an Apartheid State"""" section should really be a section of its own.  If anything, I'd move it to third, as in """"Some people make the allegation without specifying what exactly they're referring to.""""  Perhaps others should give it another look, though?

 I agree that there should be separate articles to describe the Geographical location and the navy base. 
 In addition there should be an additional article, with description of all the prisons and detention centres.   

 In my opinion those descriptions of the prisons should be brief, and each prison should have an article devoted to them.  They used to each have an article devoted to them.  The guy who merged them did a really crappy job.  And the history of their edits strongly suggest that their real intention was to obfuscate information that was embarrassing to fans of President Bush's detainee policy.  He (unfairly IMO) accused me of starting articles about Guantanamo detainees in order to spoof Google.  He accused me of trying to multiply the number of hits those who searched for Guantanamo, and abuse would find.  He initiated the formal deletion steps against close to a dozen articles I started.   

 When he first leveled this accusation against I thought it was ridiculous and impractical, in addition to being unethical and a betrayal of the wikipedia community.  But, after doing some research, I realized that he was correct about it being practical.  Many commercial sites, and some other nonprofit sites, republish wikipedia articles, so, for many topics, most of the google hits are mirrors of wikipedia articles. 

 When attempting to get others to agree to delete the articles I started failed, he merged the articles on the prisons with the support of just one other wikipedian.  I believe he was guilty of exactly what he accused me of.  I think his partisan and insincere merge had a powerful negative impact on the usefulness of the Wikipedia's coverage of Guantanamo issues.

Sitchin's Nibiru, to prevent his mythos from choking up the site, would be directed to Planets proposed in mythology, astrology and ufology, along with his other planets, Tiamat and Gaga.

 Hi Rosie. I'm sorry if I caused some confusion on the talk page of Women in Red with my comments on Metrics. Thanks for restating and clarifying your original objective. I am writing to you here because I really think it would be useful to refine AlexBot along the lines I suggested in order to remove the huge number of new articles on women in sports that are included every day so that we can concentrate more on biographies of women in other areas. The changes I suggested would be relatively easy to implement and we would have a day-to-day tally of new articles of relevance to main interests of the project. I think many of those involved in Women in Red and most of the other WikiProjects on women would agree that it is not really useful for us to review or upgrade articles on women in sports. In any case, it appears to be a sector which can take care of its own requirements. I very much hope Harej will be able to follow up on your own suggestion on metrics but if he experiences difficulty, then I think it would be useful to proceed with an alternative solution. You might be interested to know, btw, that I frequently look at the results of AlexBot for new articles on women writers and women artists. I also regularly use the AlexBot output on architecture for monitoring all the new articles created there. In many cases, I am able to edit in important improvements quite quickly and, in many cases, assign the articles to pertinent WikiProjects. I find the results extremely useful for enhancing articles sector by sector, even if about a third of them are not really relevant or worth expanding. On the other hand, I realize that it is often a tedious business to use the AlexBot output for adding to lists of new articles and agree it would be great if the operation could be partly or fully automated. But maybe we could improve both approaches at the same time. What do you think?",979,0.08551187,0.009255972,0.035027742,0.0017537695,0.02911987,0.0053083417

 In 1947 Ireland’s Department of External Affairs drafted a letter to the heads of all government departments, which was designed “to prevent the use—not only at International Conferences, but in ordinary Departmental files and correspondence here at home—of expressions which are not in accordance with our external position and may prove embarrassing to us on policy grounds.” These included the use of the term “Dominion—to describe this country; the use of Eire for Ireland, the use of the term British Isles to describe Ireland and Great Britain, of Northern Ireland to describe the six north-eastern counties, and of Government of the United Kingdom where the British Government is meant.” The expression “British Isles” was “a complete misnomer and its use should be thoroughly discouraged”; it should be replaced “where necessary by Ireland and Great Britain.”

 'since fame would justify'. Firstly, it's obviously POV, given that ideas of justification are innately subjective. Secondly, it's false. Nobody is thinking increased fame would justify an intervention, only that increased infamy is like to make an intervention more likely. Thirdly, from the shit I saw of it on facebook, I'm not sure they mentioned the U.S specifically, but I can't remember so somebody'll have to check. 

 I'd say a much better line would be something like """"The film's aim is to make Joseph Kony infamous, since wider infamy is likely to facilitate *** intervention in Kony's capture"""". Replace *** with either U.S or international or whatever is most factually appropriate, and we've got a much better line.

 ::Yeah. All historic knowledge points to a predominance of Portuguese presence in the region, be it Azorean or lagunista. This is well supported by linguistic data: the region speaks Portuguese, and has spoken Portuguese from the 18th century, when this language superceded, not Castillian, but Guarani and other Amerindian languages. Andrea Rita Marrero's paper goes against this mainstream view and seems unsupported by any other sources. Moreover, when she discusses European vs Amerindian genetic ancestry, she gives details about what haplogroups support her findings, with tables, percents, and detailed discussion. When she discusses Portuguese vs Spanish genetic ancestry, there is nothing similar, just guesses and possibilities; no haplogroups are named and discussed, there are no tables, no percents, no verifiable discussion. 

 ::Indeed, I would like to know what haplogroups can be considered reliable markers of Spanish vs Portuguese ancestry; after all, the historic origin of both (Spanish and Portuguese) population is similar. The first actual noticeable separation between Portugal and Spain dates from 409-585 AD (the Swabian and Visigoth realms in the aftermath of the fall of the Roman Empire); but it is well know that both Swabians and Visigoths left smallish imprints in the demographic of the region. During the Reconquista, Portugal was indeed a feud of Castille up to 1139 (I wonder when this will be brought into discussion, to prove that all Brazilians - as well as all Portuguese - are of Spanish descent). Is there any user with actual knowledge in the field of genetics that can help us with that? 

 ::I suppose when you say that the """"mtDNA of the Gaúchos surprised me, as it is lower than that of Argentina (which is 56%), and lower than that of the interior of Uruguay (about 60%)"""" you are refering to Amerindian MtDNA? Do you have cites for those figures? This would be very interesting.   """,989,0.084481224,0.009206704,0.034979325,0.0017527421,0.028910672,0.0053221113

I've been building this article here and there over two years and thus it could be a little more cohesive. Your c/e is terrific, I'll make certain not to interfere with your changes - just want to make it a bit better  and thanks, glad you enjoyed the read. I don't normally edit pageant articles but I think this biography is very interesting and worthy of a GA and thus have worked hard on it and related articles for awhile.
