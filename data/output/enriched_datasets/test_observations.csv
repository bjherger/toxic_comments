This is the last of my involvement in this bizarrely combative incident (I'm going to avoid you entirely in the future after reading all of your truly awkward and self-aggrandizing paragraphs on your user page detailing all of the times your teachers supposedly lavished praise on you and begged you to go into a variety of fields because of your supposed otherworldly intellect; that was surreal to read), but you seem to have misunderstood the proceedings above. The initial argument started with several users objecting to the inclusion of some """"fan criticism"""" that referenced the opinions of """"men's rights activists"""". This was removed promptly for obvious reasons. You then went back and re-added this information and expanded upon it. This obviously doesn't constitute a """"brief mention"""", something that Cyphoidbomb was noncommittal about in his overall discention in regards to its inclusion. You included far too much of Parramore's opinion; it was larger than the entire rest of the paragraph. There's no need to address the opinions of a few misogynists marketing themselves as """"men's rights activists"""" who criticized the movie; it represents a WP:FRINGE opinion and should not be included. While I generally like the information you added and agree with Parramore's overall sentiment in regards to the insecurities of those male critics, it still addresses a WP:FRINGE opinion and was far too lengthy, signifying WP:UNDUE, as Sock said. The brief sentence or two that now references the opinions of feminists is all that is required as it represents the view of a legitimate activist group.

 ::I Have The Power, by Tycho - Fri, December 16 2005 - 07:58 AM 

 ::As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia has some issues. As a model of how and where distributed intellect fails, it's almost shockingly comprehensive.  

 ::When we were first considering making Epic Legends Of The Hierarchs available as a publicly manageable satirical metanarrative, we dropped the basic timeline on Wikipedia because I liked the way their software went about things. Of course, a phalanx of pedants leapt into action almost immediately to scour - from the sacred corpus of their data - our revolting fancruft.  

 ::That's okay with me. I wasn't aware they thought they were making a real encyclopedia for big people at the time, and if I had, I'd have sought out one of the many other free solutions. I had seen the unbelievably detailed He-Man and Pokémon entries and assumed - like any rational person would - that Pokémaniacs were largely at the rudder of the institution. 

 ::I am almost certain that - while they prune their deep mine of trivia - they believe themselves to be engaged in the unfolding of humanity's Greatest Working.  

 ::Responses to criticism of Wikipedia go something like this: the first is usually a paean to that pure democracy which is the project's noble fundament. If I don't like it, why don't I go edit it myself?  To which I reply: because I don't have time to babysit the Internet. Hardly anyone does. If they do, it isn't exactly a compliment.  

 ::Any persistent idiot can obliterate your contributions. The fact of the matter is that all sources of information are not of equal value, and I don't know how or when it became impolitic to suggest it. In opposition to the spirit of Wikipedia, I believe there is such a thing as expertise. 

 ::The second response is: the collaborative nature of the apparatus means that the right data tends to emerge, ultimately, even if there is turmoil temporarily as dichotomous viewpoints violently intersect. To which I reply: that does not inspire confidence. In fact, it makes the whole effort even more ridiculous. What you've proposed is a kind of quantum encyclopedia, where genuine data both exists and doesn't exist depending on the precise moment I rely upon your discordant fucking mob for my information.",8,0.1441314,0.0077742296,0.074547224,0.0024746493,0.049764574,0.01222486

A guy I knew who took the test was taken to the Angeles Forest for the multiple attacker scenario. He told me how he had to use camouflage and stealth techniques as well. Testers were graded on all that stuff. It was very militaristic. I learned alot. More than most people learn in Dojos or Gyms today. What I learned saved my butt a few times. But, was it ninjutsu? honestly it was not. Frank Dux was trying to make money and who can blame him. We live in a capitalist and free market society. From what I have learned since then is that even Masaaki Hatsumi is considered a fraud in some circles. There are some Japanese who say his evidence of his lineage is shady and that the Iga and Koga Schools had died out long before his claims and that his teacher simply used the word ninjutsu without any evidence.

Come on, man we're an encyclopedia  our goal is to define what """"Ars Technica"""" IS, not who owns it.  People reading the article really, honestly don't care that the web site is owned by a company with the same name as the web site.  We also don't need to describe minute details of subscriptions or renewals; again, terms of use do not hold much in the way of encyclopedic value.  Always bear this in mind: WIKIPEDIA IS NOT THE INTERNET  we don't need to collate every possible little piece of information, if it's readily available on the public web site the article talks about.  This saves us the rather onerous responsibility of updating the article when some of these minute details change.    

 ::: When something is interesting, and has high informative value, it belongs in Wikipedia. For example, the article on Starbucks devotes some space to their non-smoking policy because it has been controversial in some countries with a strong smoking culture... however, we don't report on what kind of cash registers Starbucks uses in their stores, because it is of low informative value. 

 ::: Anyways, if you need more examples of how Wikipedia deals with tech sites, Have a look at AnandTech, Tom's Hardware Guide, HardOCP, Blue's News, Penny Arcade (webcomic), Experts-Exchange, or any number of Ars Technica's peers.

This month long discussion we are currently in, is the only serious discussion of changing the lead that has been proposed.  The language re: the number and names of the investigations was placed in the lead sometime in late 2006/2007. In September of 09, someone replaced that language with """"Oswald is the assassin"""", which instituted a discussion that lasted half a day.  I replaced that edit with the language that was there until Rudioso showed up about a month ago.  The point in relaying this history is that the edit history does not support that there has been some longstanding feud about the language of this introduction or that mentioning the investigations will somehow allow these discussion to continue.  In fact, the actual history tells us that the only time objections arise is when editors change it to state Oswald is the assassin.  Rudioso is the first and only editor who's objected to the statements of investigations since it's been introduced.  Now, I'm all for trying something new, but I think that since none of the proposals have garnered the support required to claim a new consensus it is best that we go back to what was there before Rudioso briefly objected.  That version clearly had consensus, something that no new proposal has garnered.

 Hi, and welcome to WikiProject Articles for creation! We are a group of editors who work together on the Articles for creation and Files for upload pages. 

 A few tips that you might find helpful: 
 * Please take time to fully read the reviewers' instructions before reviewing submissions. 
 * The reviewers' talk page is the best place to ask for help or advice. You might like to watchlist this page, and you are encouraged to take part in any discussion that comes up. 
 * Article submissions that need reviewing can be found in Category:Pending AfC submissions and there is also a useful list which is maintained by a bot. 
 * You might wish to add  or  to your userpage, which will alert you to the number of open submissions. There is also a project userbox. If you haven't done so already, please consider adding your name to the list of participants. 
 * Several of our members monitor the  IRC channel, and you are welcome to join in to ask Wikipedia-related questions. 
 * The IRC channel  is used occasionally for internal discussion regarding the Articles for Creation process, and also serves as a recent changes feed, displaying all edits made in the Articles for Creation namespace. 
 * The help desk is the place where new editors can ask questions about their submissions. You are welcome to help in answering their questions. 
 Once again, welcome to the project.

In the field of cutting-edge technology, aerospace engineering to bear the brunt, most important, led the way, an extremely important area for future development of human society. In a sense, it will completely change the rewrite human history and natural history of the universe. Particularly with regard to Mars landing, establishing a lunar base, the Moon of Earth, Mars, the planet of the countries in the world put a lot of manpower, material and financial resources to develop the breakthrough Figure in cosmic science. Mars landing probably need to invest billions of dollars to, or less, if the budget billions of dollars can also be piloted. Simple lunar base only about several hundred billion dollars to the initial shape. The large-scale transformation of the moon, Mars transform costly, it can not be said to astronomical, but it also needs tens of trillions of dollars. Save some estimates, at least invest between $ trillions and tens of trillions of dollars. Of course, technically feasible, the return naturally considerable, about investment profits worth hundreds of times, this is self-evident. Water temperature, air is the most important prerequisite for the existence of life. Planet trillions of kilometers away, rather than the Earth, very, difficult to imagine in the north and south. The most critical scientific research is Earth, the Moon, Mars or other planets countless whether absolute 'homogeneity', or 'heterogeneity', which is the major issue of great concern to scientists. 

  

 Space science and technology major cutting-edge technology are many, but the most important to solve the most urgent of the most critical include the following 30 top cutting-edge technology. The following are described as follows: """"design, drawings, patents, know-how, formulas, processes, materials, etc.). Aerospace science and technology, space technology high investment, high risk, therefore, very important systems integration technology, safe, reliable and feasible, low-cost, otherwise, even the best technical drawings also will become a dead letter, shelved, it is the success of R & D The key lies. Thus, R & D 30 cutting-edge technology can be streamlined to save, for example, simulation, simulation, simulation design, simulation, design, and so on, with high high high intelligence capability means a significant reduction in a variety of research costs. For example, the spacecraft design, spacecraft dynamic design, automatic control, new materials, Mars geology, etc., greatly reducing the development costs. 

  
 Mainly to solve the major cutting-edge technology, including (1) the planet water synthesis. Regardless of the moon or Mars, water is undoubtedly the source of life. Overcome difficulties water is primary sophisticated high-end technology. Water Planet manufacture of synthetic technology. As long as this technology breakthrough, it means that the human world greatest success. Of course, there are in-depth exploration and mining of groundwater resources of the planet, there may be possibilities. (2) Preparation of air oxygen composite technology. This is not very difficult. (3) temperature, energy technologies. This technique has difficulty factor, but not very obvious. (4). Speeding spaceship energy technology. The new spacecraft. (5). A full life support systems technology. (6). Biosystems survival techniques. (7). Cosmic radiation radiation technology and specialty materials. Special space suits. This technique also requires breakthroughs. (7) Space inst",127,0.14525394,0.007770571,0.0750556,0.0024886027,0.049903307,0.012264775

 In the spring of 1942, during the Dutch East Indies campaign, Amatsukaze attacked the already damaged submarine USS Perch on the surface with gunfire, and observed hits.  Perch submerged and escapted, but the next night was caught on the surface while attempting repairs by two different Japanese destroyers, and was scuttled. 

 During the Carrier battle of the Eastern Solomons the captain of Amatsukaze sent one of the most unusual messages ever sent by a Japanese vessel during the war, when he sent a signal to the carrier Ryujo asking them why there was no combat air patrol.  Ryujo then readied zero fighters, but was attacked and sunk by aircraft before they could take off. 

 Amatsukaze and another destroyer raided the atoll of Ndeni, far south of Guadalcanal and used by PBY flying boats, two weeks prior to the carrier battle of Santa Cruz, but the atoll did not have any planes there during the surface raid. 

 At the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November 1942, Amatsukaze first sank the destroyer USS Barton with torpedoes, then turned north and a short time later hit the light cruiser USS Juneau with one torpedo, crippling the ship.  Juneau was sunk the next day by Japanese submarine I-26.  Amatsukaze also hit the heavy cruiser USS San Francisco with gunfire during the battle.",146,0.14445944,0.0077572656,0.07480171,0.0024831542,0.04963905,0.0122140795

The modern Conservative Party is a new political party that was formed after the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party dissolved themselves. It is not the legal contiuation of either party. The PC Party wentr through several name changes during its long history, including Liberal-Conservative Party, Conservative Party, Unionist Party, and so on. But that party was dissolved in 2003.

 == Progress report: Country outlines == 

 Development has been slow but continuous: 

  has done a fantastic job on the images for the awards we'll be using for our project's collaborations and contests.  We now have 3 awards: a medal, a trophy, and a race ribbon.  They all look tight.  The trophy needs a small adjustment, but other than that, all 3 award images are complete and ready to use to create awards with. 

 Spartaz has warned us of (threatened to take) G4 (speedy delete) action if we run a competition that resembles the previously deleted Awards Center page.  So whatever we do, any contests we run must differ substantially from the methods used there.   

 One type of competition I've been exploring is edit racing.  I'm in the process of working the bugs out of this concept - the first race didn't work as expected - you see, because we only had an award for first place, the opponent didn't think it worthwhile to continue once it was clear who the winner would be.  And since editors are in different time zones and usually need to start the race at different times, we need to base winning on personal start times - he who completes his assigned edits in the least time (rather than first), wins.  And last but not least is quality control.  What good is winning if your edits are ripe with errors?  So I'll be exploring possibilities such as using a referee (whoever is overseeing a particular race), having participants watching each other for errors to knock them back, etc.  I'm not sure yet. 

  has been applying his bot expertise to filling in blanks in the country outlines (the population and area entries).  I'm amazed at the number of edits he pumps out each day on a myriad of projects - ours makes up but a small time slice of his activity, and yet he has saved us many hours of manual work.  Perhaps we should look into how he gets so much done.  ) 

  has chosen to work on one outline at a time, and is taking on Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.  He also has been keen on noticing and reporting design issues pertaining to the whole set of country outlines.  Keep up the good work! 

  has been filling in the names of capitals, and is our first race winner.  Check out the award on his user pages. 

 As you probably know, this project has expanded to include working on any and all sets of pages that are linked to from the country outlines.  Once the set of country outlines go live (in article space), traffic will likely increase for all the links included on them.  The quality and usefulness of those pages will reflect heavily on the country outlines (the outlines, which are essentially lists of links, are only as good as the links they present), and therefore we've branched out to solve the biggest problems with those as well.  So far, we've taken on: 
 * The creation of disambiguation pages for country adjectivals (""""German"""", """"French"""", """"Taiwanese"""", etc.  About half done.)  
 * The clean-up of the CIA World Factbook statistics on the """"demographics of"""" country pages.  We've been renaming those sections to provide a key string that AWB can use for targetting (for skipping and filtering).  Once that's done, we'll be able to break the clean-up down into simple AWB search/replace tasks, because we'll be able to target just those pages that include the CIA stuff. 
 * Renaming the """"Cuisine of"""" articles to their adjectival forms (""""Chinese cuisine"""", """"Italian cuisine"""", etc.) 

  and  have been helping out with the """"demographics of"""" pages mentioned above. 

 And we have a couple speed addicts (addicted to wiki-velocity, not drugs)... 

 Both  and  prefer (and excel at) simple AWB search/replaces. Robert hasn't actually joined our team yet, but he has been helping out quite a bit from the sidelines (via the WP:AWB/Tasks page.  Unfortunately, there has recently been a non-AWB chore that has been holding things up on the AWB front - an edit to all the the headings which had to be reverted before too many new edits were made, because any new edits would make the reversion more difficult.  The headings have been restored, so now the way is clear for AWB operations, and there are many search/replace tasks in the queue.

A lot of editors don't use edit summaries as often as they should, but I think it's particularly important to do so on contentious articles so that other editors can know if you are making significant changes or not.

 == Hi == 

 regarding some entry changes i made to the page """"neyyi"""" -redirected to """"ghee"""". 

 I hope this is the right lace to post it. 
 i've been called a vandal and the edits i made unconstructive.  
 i refute both of these charges/allegations. 
 neyyi-an butter-like food product found in India is eaten all over India. Not just hindi-speaking parts. 
 I is borderline racist and certainly immoral (if that is the intent) to marginalize every other language's word for this product and use a majority language word.  
 Ghee outside of Hindi-speaking parts may not even be known or understood. I'd like to think wikipedia is a place that respects all of the world's languages,customs etc.  

 I never got the memo that Hindi is the defacto language that represents all of India.  

 Thank you.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 you said it yourself..its an english language page. 
 what does ghee have to do w/ any of that?  
 Ghee is hindi. If you want to use ghee, then neyyi should be equally acceptable. 
 The english word would be clarified-butter. I'm more than happy to have that replace either language's words.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 so why do we have a problem? 
 i replaced neyyi w/ ghee. both are acceptable then right? both are equal in validity right?  — Preceding unsigned comment added by

88447,938841d37789f7e9,"Drew Pickles grew up as a gay child. When he was just born, his cock was five feet long. It grew much bigger every second when he was very young. Drew liked to masturbate to The Wiggles, SpongeBob and Dragon Tales. His dick got very hard, and much longer. When Drew was the age of five years old, he started his first day of school, with a twenty mile long cock hiding in his pants. He always fucked the kids in the classroom, and splooged on the teacher, and he's destroyed some school propety with his large cock. Things were getting out of control. Drew fucked about 5,000 kids at his school and the kids got all horny and fucked everything in the school, and then they cummed all over eachother and made a swimming pool in their school of cum. When Drew was 10 years old, he liked to poop on his dad (who is now called Grandpa Louis) all day. In fact, Drew skipped lots of school because he wanted to stick dildos up his ass and poop on his Grandpa all day. When Drew was 11, he got this own computer with the Internet installed. Drew jacked off to Wiggles hentai and Arthur scat porn. He couldn't stop. He couldn't go to sleep for almost a whole week, just sitting there, jacking off to the pornographic Wiggles images on his computer. He couldn't stop! He started getting erections all the time from SpongeBob and Barney, so Drew visited the gay bar twice a day to strip for gay old men, and Drew received lots of money to buy dildos to stick up his ass all day. Drew was a gay stripper for twenty years. When Drew was about thirty-five, he was married with Charolette. Drew didn't want to be married with a woman, but Drew was tired of men for that period. But then Drew decided to fuck men instead of women, so he raped men every night when Charolette is sleeping. Drew does not want Charolette to know he rapes men at nighttime. Sometimes Drew raped Angelica in the ass all day, he said it was oodles of fun, so he did it all the time. Drew entered himself in the Boner Baseball League, and won every boner baseball game. He won the championship of the Boner Baseball League every year. Drew was sent to Barney's Penis World to play the worldwide Boner Baseball Superbowl! He did successful in this superbowl, and he even performed in the halftime show by doing magic tricks with his dick.  

 Drew Pickles starred in over 67,000 pornos. Most of the pornos had Big Bird, Wiggles, Stu Pickles or Barney in it. Drew Pickles made over eight-hundred million dollars for creating this pornos.

 2) Lucius Valerius Flaccus, Marcus Atilius Serranus and Lucius Valerius Tappo were not consuls, but triumviri coloniae deducendae, i.e. special magistrates appointed to found the colony. Only the first of then had been consul in 195 BC

When you use a generic fair use tag such as {{fair use}} or {{fair use in|article name}}, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. 

 Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. 

 If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too.

Whether you like it or not, Wikipedia's inclusion guidelines do not offer the leader of a city council an automatic right to keep a Wikipedia article on the basis of a single source which merely namechecks their existence — no matter what role a city councillor holds (plain old councillor, leader of the council, one year in the ceremonial rotation of mayors, head of a council committee, whatever), the only criterion in WP:NPOL that any city councillor can ever satisfy just because of their city council position alone is """"major local political figures who have received significant press coverage"""" (i.e. who have passed WP:GNG as individuals in their own right). So if you cannot explicitly demonstrate that the significant press coverage is there — it cannot simply be assumed to exist, but must actually be shown — then they do not get a Wikipedia article regardless of what role they held on the city council. This is not a """"lie""""; it's a completely correct and accurate and true assessment of what Wikipedia's inclusion rules for politicians say about city councillors.

You're claiming that I cast personal aspersions on him as an individual — but I didn't. You're claiming that I'm failing to understand that """"a leader is more important than a regular councillor"""" — but that distinction does not make a difference to Wikipedia's inclusion rules, which whether you like the fact or not do not grant the leader of a city council any greater entitlement to have a Wikipedia article than any other city councillor gets. Any city councillor, leader or not, has to pass GNG to qualify for an article on here. And at no point in the entire discussion did I say even one word about anything beyond the question of Wikipedia's inclusion rules.  
 ::::You're entirely within your right to believe that our inclusion criteria for city councillors should be different than they are, and to pursue a consensus discussion to try to get them changed to your liking. But you're not entitled to call someone a liar for accurately summarizing what the current consensus is for the inclusion or exclusion of city councillors. 
 ::::I said all along that the article could be kept if enough sourcing were added to get him past GNG — but instead of adding sourcing, you simply dismissed the incontrovertibly true fact that NPOL does not confer an automatic presumption of notability on city councillors as """"lies"""", and attacked me instead of the real problem (the quality of sourcing). The discussion's now been closed """"no consensus"""", but the reason that happened is because another editor ponied up with some actual sourcing and content improvements. You were the only person to vote keep before that improvement happened, and your rationale was a personal attack on me in which you failed to engage the fact that the article didn't satisfy any of Wikipedia's inclusion rules in its original form. It got kept because the article got improved, not because anybody (least of all me) was """"lying"""" about anything.

 Preface 

 """"Ashram creates itself so holy an environment that when a car passes right there in front of an ashram, the driver feels some strange feeling in his tires. Something so holy, something so attractive, something so elegant, because in this world, we can walk in the streets and we can see the lights and when you drive at night, you might feel a strange reaction because of all these lights there. But in the ashram, no lights, but internal light's still glowing. Everyone is completely amazed when he sees the light coming through, because when people meditate, there is clearly light coming out of them. 

 """"And when man does meditation, then it really comes out of him, he becomes a part of the meditation, like if you go to a tub and there is white paint in it, and you go down in the tub and come out, then you'll be all white, because that white color has touched you and become a part of you. So, when we stick to something, when we stick to Knowledge, we become a part of Knowledge. 

 """"And what is Knowledge? Knowledge is light. And we have to become light and everyone wants to become light. He glows, but not for himself he glows, he glows for everyone. If I'm a man, and I have got a torch and there are a hundred people following me, they can all see clearly, because if only one man has a torch, a hundred people can see. So when you glow, you don't show direction to yourself, but you show how to be, how to be. 

 """"Now you see, God is the controller, it is His control trip. Why do you only see with your eyes, why not with your mouth or with your nose? Why only with your eyes? You talk about it being a control trip, then why do you only see with your eyes and not with your mouth? Why? Because that's the way things are, and that's the way things are going to be, understand? A man who sees through his mouth, you're not going to call him a man. You're going to call him a monster! A man must see through his eyes and that's the way it must be. 

 """"Ashram has to be an ashram and it's not a motel. You don't go into a church and just start sleeping there and drinking your coffee there. You don't do that, do you? A church is a church, a temple is a temple; you are strict about doing certain things there. Understand? You go to a church; you pray, you meditate, you read something, you understand something, and become more spiritual, right? 

 """"Why should there be so much strictness? We are the children of God, and this is the house of God. That's why there should be so much strictness. That's the way it has to be, that's why. So that's what I wanted to make clear about it."""" 

 (Note: the above quotes are from Guru Maharaji himself. They've been lifted from satsangs Guru Maharaj Ji gave - during ashram pressure-cooker meetings - to the Ashram premies in the early 70s, and those quotes constitute the preface of the 'Ashram Manual'.)

 Hi Anagnorisis,  Thanks for your support.  I'm writing to you here because it will be far easier to have this conversation in your good English than in my beginners Spanish.

Have you any background or is there anything I could read on es.wiki about the possible reasons?

 == Congrats for """"your"""" day! == 

 Hello LadyofShalott. Congratulations for having now your day. It must feel good! 
 Well, since you have been so nice and kind, I couldn´t refrain myself from not asking you for advice. I have been involved in a hard discussion regarding an historical issue. It has to do with the monopolization of a serious of related articles by one editor. basicaly, this editor  insists in considering an resistance monarchic movement (Chetniks) and its leader (Draža Mihailović) a Nazy collaborator. The movement fought the Germans, but also the Tito´s Partisans (another resistance group). Since the second ones won the war, Tito condemned and executed Mihailovic, charging him on treason. USA organised an post-mortum trial and freed the movement of the charges, and condecorated Mihailovic. France too. Since the movement fought both, the Germans and the Partisans, some detachments ocasionally collaborated, but it was maynly a three side war. Anyway, this user, Direktor, manipulating and exageratins sources that talk about that ocasional collaboration, wants to impose that the entire movement and Mihailovic are to be considered """"notable collaborators"""", and its role as resistance efforts ignored. Well, despite WP:AGF, this user as a Croat and assumed Titoist, Tito was the leader of the Partisans, a communist guerilla, obviously has no nice feelings towards a Serb monarchic movement, and edited the article having in mind only his POV. The worst is that when other editors want to edit the articles, he is very agressive and reverts all that doesn´t fit his ideology. He was blocked several times for breaking the 3r role. I demanded that the article includes more NPOV, so a discussion started. Another editor that also agrees with me already asked for mediation, so wi will see what will happend. A nazy collaboration accusation is a too serious accusation to be left unsourced. Anyway, my problem is regarding this users attitude towards me. He constantly manipulates my words (same way as he does with the sources) and does all the possible and impossible so his version will prevail. He unfairlly accused me of many things, but when talking about me or my edits he used the following expressions: Lack of knolledge/info (7times), Nonsence (5 times),  Horrible/faulty grammar (5 times), Me having no idea whatsoever (3 times), childish (2 times), Lying (2 times), Me being nationalist (2 times), unnencyclopedic (2 times), Absurd (2 times), Stupid (1 time), Clumsy (1 time), Silly (1 time), Ridiculous (2 times), Slauderous (1 time), My opinion irrelevant (1 time), me joking (1 time), Missinformed (1 time), Utterly flawed ideas (1 time) and many more indirectly tageting me. When I asked him please to be polite and avoid using this expressions, he accused me of imagining provocation. He also constantly speaks as he is a """"community"""". The discussion is found here: Talk:Draža Mihailović. Should I report him for this behaviour?

 ==Kenny's Death== 
 So...you have to look up the individual episode to find his death? WTF happened to the table? Also should we add an 'Episodes Where Kenny is Prominent' - I mean, he's in almost every non-Season 6 episode, but he's not so important to most of them and usually has under 10 lines.    

 == OR and Cruft. == 

 I have added tags on original research and fancruft because of such things as his talents section and his friends section. Some bits of these sections should be mentioned briefly in his bio, but Wikipedia is not a documentary of all character aspects, and should not go into full detail on whether or not Kyle and Stan are close to the core with Kenny or not. One or two sentences would do just fine. 

 Sirening for original research is due to the bit about the curtains and his parka. I agree, it is heavily likely, but much as we all might agree that's where it's made from, due to wikipedia's policy against unverifiable claims, it cannot be included here.    

 I added the 'Talents' and 'Friends and Family' section because most of the other characters have it. I'll remove parts of them.    

 C'mon here, I've removed most of the 'Fancruft' and now it's down to his best friend and family - it NEEDS to be there. The other main boys have it and they don't get the stupid tag, so can it be removed now?    
 :Do you know how to remove a tag? If so, you can take the fansite tag off.    

 I thought normal users couldn't remove tags.    
 :Oh, but they can. I put tags up and down on lots of articles, for lots of reasons. I'll take it down if you'd rather, though.    

 I removed """"Fancruft"""" - I removed most, if not all, Fancraft pointed out above, and kept enough that it should not be removed unless it's also removed from the other articles, as well as """"Length"""" because I'd say it's about as long as the other boys' articles now.    

 ==Character Biography== 
 Perhaps we should add a sort of 'Biography' of him in the aritcle - it might fall under 'Chateracterization' - I more so mean a history of him from the earlies to later episodes in order and etc. Is it a good idea? Would the article be too long then?    

 == Contradictory == 

 Aren't these statements contradicting one another? 

 Kenny is famous for dying in almost every single South Park episode, although in reality, he has only died 79 times in 174 episodes. Kenny has only died five times since he returned in Red Sleigh Down. 

 Kenny has only survived four episodes he was present in before Kenny Dies: Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo, Fat Camp, and Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow. He died in Rainforest Schmainforest, but was revived and lived to the end of the episode''. Umm...  Greenday21 

 == Possibly incorrect == 

 The article currently says, """"The only time Kenny did not die and the famous saying was uttered was on Make Love not Warcraft, when his Warcraft game avitar died."""" Is this correct? What about the Fat Camp episode where Kenny is arrested for prostitution and Eric Cartman's impostor takes Kenny's place and dies. I believe Stan and Kyle say, """"Oh my god, they killed Kenny... sort of,"""" """"You bastards... I guess."""" I am not sure, though.

 Hi NoSeptember, 

 Per your comments on my RfA, I promise that I will keep flexibility a top priority in future while editing on Wikipedia. Hope to see positive interactions with you in the future. —   

  
 ==Footer== 
 I am pretty sure that there is a way for people with popups (or lupin's autoedit JS) to automatically move the footer to the bottom using regex. I might have to ask lupin for the syntax.  

 And, using that syntax, I could make it easy to auto-archive my talkpage at a click of a button (I already have the parserfunctions set to auto-list the archive if it exists). 

 I don't know why (or how) you edit the """"old fashion way"""", because it is not good for you and you might get a cold. Can you pleasssssseeeeeeeeee try non-old fashion out? just for once?

 Hi, I was looking at Hormonal therapy (oncology) and its history, and was delighted to see that you have recently resumed editing after a long gap.  I realize this was around a particular non-medical topic, but I'm hoping I can interest you in taking a look at my Wikipedian in Residence project at Cancer Research UK, lasting until mid-December.  In terms of articles we are concentrating on Lung cancer (already FA), Pancreatic cancer, Esophageal cancer (work underway on these) and Brain tumor (shudder).  But a number of other articles are also being improved. Unfortunately your pattern of editing career is very common - much of the material on cancer was added at a high level of quality in the years up to about 2010-11, but since then relatively little has been added or updated. Nowadays medical students (which I think you were when last editing) do not take up editing as much as they did some years ago. Any contributions you care to make will be very gratefully received, even just quick review points on talk.

 |style=""""padding-left:0.6cm""""|I don't see any grounds for complaints about BLP here, since the information is something that the subject herself claims to be true. The only exception would be if Satine Phoenix has said somewhere that it's not true - the mere claim that a porn actress is in a relationship with another woman does not seem to me to be inherently libellous. 

 The question, therefore, is as to whether the subject is a RS about herself, given that the website is essentially a self-published source. The criterion that applies here is whether """"the material is... unduly self-serving"""". Given the context, it's entirely possible that this is promotional, but I don't think it's unduly self-serving, in a way that a statement such as """"...is one of the greatest porn actresses in recent history"""" might be, or even (say) what her claimed favourite sexual positions are. I would recommend making the source of the information more explicit, by saying something such as """"according to her official website...""""

 Dear Everyking, 

  
 My name is Jonathan Obar , I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, were it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students. 

  
 So a few things about the interviews: 
 * Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes. 
 * Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.) 
 * All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so. 
 * All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time. 
 * The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly. 

  
 Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead. 

 If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you. 

 Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you. 

 Sincerely, 

 Jonathan Obar",428,0.14430302,0.007819439,0.07490159,0.0024868988,0.049902555,0.012246921

 == Dating the translation of Vattel  == 

 The article says: """"An English-language translation of Emerich de Vattel's 1758 treatise The Law of Nations..."""" That's OK, but it's important for clarifying the argument of those who want to make Vattel the controlling authority on the meaning of """"natural born citizen"""" that the English language translation of Vattel that appears in the article is from 1797 and that the 1787 First American Edition of Vattel (when the Federal Convention met) and those before it said something different: """"The natives, or indigenes, are those born in the country of parents who are citizens."""" There is no mention of """"natural-born citizen."""" 

 One way to deal with this is to simply change the article to say """"A 1797 English-language translation..."""" Need this be sourced? It's easy enough to tie the translation to 1797.  Google Books has the 1797 edition online. Sourcing the earlier translation online is a more difficult problem since we're now dealing with rare books.

Perhaps a statement should be added to the top of the article to clearly define this article.  We know death by pneumonia is quite common, but in the way it happened to U.S. President W.H. Harrison, and the fact he was a famous person in history, merits a mention- in my opinion.  Technically, by definition of 'unusual death', i.e. cause of  
 death being very uncommon or rare, W.H. Harrison should not be mentioned.  Being struck and killed by lightning is very rare cause of death, so this would qualify by definition of unusual death. My opinions summarized:   

 1. We include deaths from famous people where very unusual circumstances contributed to death (although the death itself may be quite common, e.g. W.H. Harrison.)  

 2. We include deaths of noteworthy people where the death itself was very unusual, even though the circumstances that contributed to death perhaps were not. I would however omit any deaths due to rare medical conditions.",456,0.14437747,0.007752987,0.0748507,0.0024675252,0.04976128,0.012210807

 I would first like to commend you on the job well done for this article on John Ray! I was looking it over and I would just like to suggest some possible edits to make it even better.  
 First I'd like to say that in general, the lead section is good as it is clear and understandable and I feel it does a good job of outlining different subjects that he published work in and mentioning the significance of his career. However, I feel there are some pieces of information about his life in general that could be added to the introduction. For example, the introduction does not specify where John Ray was born or include information about his life in general. Although the introduction is not supposed to go into detail about his life, I feel it is lacking any background information of John Ray. Also, I personally do not see the last sentence of the first paragraph as a relevant detail to the introduction. It is an interesting fact that I believe should be mentioned later in the article when more of the detailed facts are being mentioned. 
 The structure overall is good as it includes several heading with subtopics. However, it only includes two images and I believe the inclusion of more images could benefit the article overall. I also think this article could benefit from a “See Also” section that would include links to other relevant articles that the reader may be interested in. The “Notes” section is also rather short and perhaps it could be expanded to further add to the content of the page and give the reader a more thorough understanding of this topic.  
 Although I think this article covers some sections very well, there are others that seem to be rather brief and could be elaborated on. The section that talks about John Ray’s career is extremely long in comparison to the other parts of the article. While I think this is a sub topic that has a lot of information, I still feel other sections should be elaborated on as the coverage seems to be a bit unbalanced. For example, the sections on John Ray’s later life and family as well as his definition of species are very short sections. The section that discusses Ray’s definition of species doesn’t really elaborate on it at all. It includes a quote saying what the definition is but doesn’t say anything else. I think this section could be elaborated on and include some writing and paraphrasing of what the definition is as opposed to just a quote.  
 This article includes neutral coverage as it mostly covers facts about what happened in his life and what he accomplished. Perhaps the article could be improved if there was a section added that talked about the way different people viewed his ideas and perhaps some criticism as the facts included can make it look like John Ray didn’t run into any skeptics along the way.  
 This article has a good amount of references relative to its length and appears to have many reliable sources. The only thing is that the “Other Sources” section is a little short and could benefit from including some more secondary sources to get an array of viewpoints.",495,0.14423461,0.007758543,0.07508209,0.0024826557,0.049867634,0.012224492

In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. 

 Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale.

 or not  this user is doing nothing but vandalizing Wikipedia talk 
 pages, so this IP adddress is blocked. Modemac 16:29, 22 September 
 2005 (UTC) 

 I never vandalized and he fanatical Scientology hater and Wikipedia 
 administrator blocked me forever. 

 Read here more of Eric Walker's unconstitutional activities against me: 

 """"If the IPs used by Barbara Schwarz are blocked, this will cut off 
 access to three public libraries"""" - edit summary by """"Modemac,"""" 10 
 October 2005 

 And here is more of Modemac who thinks that I have no right for freedom 
 of speech: 

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/204.... 
 """"Okay...I assume the point of this RfC is to get an endorsement for 
 completely blocking off the known I.P. addresses used by Barbara 
 Schwarz. If so, then I'm for it.  ) Actually, this may be a newsworthy 
 event in itself, because it means that out of necessity, Wikipedia 
 would be blocking all edits made from three public libraries in that 
 vicinity. If a full block goes into effect, then we may actually want 
 to contact their local newspaper (probably the same one that did the 
 original expose of Schwarz) and make them aware of it.""""  Modemac 

  
 """"we may actually want to contact their local newspaper and make them 
 aware of it."""" - Modemac 

 He is like a communist who fears speech that he can't dictate. What is 
 newsworthy about the crimes that blue collar anti-free speech activist 
 Eric Walker commits? They are just newsworthy for a criminal 
 investigator. 

 Modemac doesn't seem to care or realize how his actions make him look. 
 I know him as an instigator, propagandist and anti-free speech 
 activist. He stops my right for free speech and wants to have me 
 smeared in the media. 

 I got this also this on him:

  my comments follow, bluewillow991967 - 

 I'm sorry if I wasn't sufficiently clear.  

 On the specific subject of """"first serial"""" versus """"reprints"""" I have an interest because I write commercial fiction for a living. 

 I'm not saying a contract would contain a """"non-standard definition"""" of first serial, original, or reprint. 

 I'm saying that you quite clearly do not understand the *standard* definitions in publishing commercial fiction of first serial, original, and reprint. 

 """"Is"""" means the same thing in plain English as it does in intellectual property terminology. """"Reprint,"""" """"original"""" and """"first serial"""" mean much more specific things in intellectual property terminology than they do in colloquial English. 

 It may well be suitable to call a female crotch a vagina in a personal blog, but in an encyclopedia article talking about female genitalia, it matters that the colloquially used term is factually incorrect and the correct terminology should be used. If the correct terminology would be confusing to readers, then a hyperlink to a correct definition may be in order. 

 You are, by analogy, effectively insisting that a set of labia is a vagina. 

 (Sorry, clearest example I could think of where the commonly accepted vernacular term shouldn't be used in an encyclopedia article because it's wrong.)

 == A possible error on the main page today == 

 I see it still says """"the encyclopedia that anyone can edit"""", despite the increasing use of semi-protection and protection on assorted article pages not just acutely in response to an immediate problem, but chronically. I know of several article pages that have not been in an """"anyone can edit"""" state for months without remit. 

 To top it off, today I came across a talk page that was semiprotected. It is absolutely incorrect to ever protect a talk page! 

 I submit, therefore, that the """"anyone can edit"""" phrase should be removed, since it isn't true any more. Alternatively, this tendency towards chronic protection can be stopped, and no more protection of talk pages occur. 

 Vandalism is of course a problem. But chronically protecting anything but the main page and stable templates isn't the answer; blocking vandals by IP is, and possibly adding a probationary status of some kind that kicks in before being blocked does (and is temporary if the bad behavior stops and remains absent long enough). Probationary status could block the editing of major, stable articles (the ones commonly chronically semiprotected now). It might also attach to newbies, but be removed by a history of good edits, only coming back if malicious edits are made. More good edits could remove it, with more being required the poorer your history. Blocking would still result from too many, malicious enough edits in too short a time period.

 I will go through and try to correct the tone to use proper encyclopedic language. 
 The issue about references is a more difficult one. I understand the need for recent secondary source references, and do my best to provide secondary source material.

 == Requesting assitance in the article """"Iranian Azeris"""" == 

 Dear Seraphimblade 

 I have had a discussion in the article Iranian Azeris for a long time now. However I feel I am being rejected ground by the oposing Iranian view presented to me by Iranians. Recently I was able to present very reliable reports from UNHRC as well as both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. However these were not replied to in a weeks time so I took the initiative of editing the article. I was very astounded when a fellow editor, without a signle comment deleted the whole section I had created. He said """"conduct changes with a discussion"""" however he failed to acknowlege the fact that there was a 20 paged discussion which he himself contributed to in the talk page. A discussion in which he did not reply to my last argument. After i explained this to him i reverted the page. Then an (Iranian) administrator came and said there is an edit war and I should not edit. He also deleted my section and said my sources were not reliable enough. However he did not feel the need to discuss as to why they were not reliable. Please help me out.  

 Thank you for your time.

I don't remember who the editor was, perhaps it was (?), but I was told that the tablet they used did not render 30em very well at all, and that 20em worked much better for them.  So I've been using 20em ever since.  As this is an important accessibility issue, I would advise all to be as sensitive as possible to the needs of others.  If this means that 30em is better for some but not all, and those some can live with 20em even though it's not quite as good for them as 30em is, then to be accessible to all, the choice should really be 20em, or perhaps slice it down the middle to 25em.

 I don't know if this is a problem with this article specifically, but I posted this on some other articles relating to 9/11 conspiracy theories and thought it might be helpful here. 

 In articles on fringe topics, we are not supposed represent the fringe theory as if it is a legitimate viewpoint or on some kind of equal footing.  Instead, we're supposed to fairly represent all sides of an issue per reliable sources.  If reliable sources reflect a particular viewpoint, then we're supposed to represent that viewpoint as well.  In a case such as this article, I doubt if there are many (if any) reliable sources that claim the WTC was destroyed via controlled demolition.  Even if there are any, weight should be roughly proportional to the preponderance of reliable sources backing that perspective. 

 As a result, there might be a WP:NPOV issue with this article.  This article should treat this topic in the same manner as reliable sources do.  Thus, if NIST, Popular Mechanics, the BBC, ABC News, Time Magazine, etc. regard the controlled demolition conspiracy theory as outlandish bunk unsupported by factual evidence, that that's how this article should be written.  To do otherwise, is against WP:NPOV. 

 In other words, the viewpoints of reliable sources are the standard by which we write our articles and judge its neutrality.",733,0.14391853,0.007764103,0.07470251,0.0024768503,0.049769036,0.012236739

 On the page for Queer, it said that the word is used for anyone not both heterosexual and cisgender. As a straight (heterosexual) trans woman doing this erases my identity. Historically having grown up in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, queer was a sexuality slur. Tranny or shemale was a slur against me. I've been called queer, a fag, and a tranny many times in my life. Queer and fag were sexuality slurs. 

 There is a large section of straight trans men and women who distance themselves from the LGBT movement because of the queer washing of all gender minorities. It always feels like I'm outnumbered when I point these things out to queer cis and trans people because I feel like a minority as a straight trans woman, but is there a way to reflect in the article that straight, binary identified trans people are pushed away from the LGBT by using a reclaimed sexuality slur for straight gender minorities?",739,0.14671732,0.0076717464,0.075032584,0.0024476454,0.04970252,0.012150295

 The human ersatz who claimed credit above for deleting the Deckard=Descartes piece is – in the tone he's himself accustomed to for qualifying others – the dumberest ignorant idiot: 

 * Dick, who majored in German, would hardly ignore that """"-ard"""" is pronounced """"-art"""" in German – cf. current German chancellor Gerhard Schröder, whose first name is pronounced /gair-hart/. 

 * Dick, who was so interested in philosophy, would hardly ignore that Descartes, philosopher of the """"Cogito, ergo sum """" (I think, therefore I am) and eponymous of 'cartesian', was an ideal reference for his Deckard. 

 * Dick, who named his literary alter-ego """"Horselover Fat"""" because """"Philo hippos"""" is Greek for """"Horse lover"""" and """"Dick"""" is German for """"fat"""", is hardly the last one can suspect of such games with names. 

 Unfortunately, if  seems to be a dick, he's not of the Philip K. sort.

 == Cannel from Lycopsid spores== 
 I'll add a note that cannel coal comes from Lycopsid (scale tree) spores, accumulating in coal swamp pond bottoms.  Thus cannel coal seams are shallow and often found above other deposits, while the coal itself, being rich in oils, burns long, with a bright yellow flame and little ash. 

 Don't ask me how to cite it, but the source of this information is the National Museum of Natural History, where one reads: 
 """"LCYOPSIDS  SCALE TREES.  One of the major plants of the coal swamps, lycopsids sometimes reached heights of 125 feet... Lycopsids are known as scale trees because their bark is marked by scars (where leaves were attached) that reminded coal miners of fish or reptile scales.""""  And: """"SCALE-TREE SPORES.  Scale trees produced spores in such vast quantities that the spores often filled small ponds in the coal swamp.  The remains of these lycopsid spores were transformed into a special type of coal, cannel coal, highly prized for use in fireplaces.""""  And another sign mentions the high oil content in spore-based cannel coal (don't have quote).  I'm sure there's more complexity to the story that others may want to add, but, however simplified, this is a reliable source!

 Sorry about the RVV label; I have been barely sweeping articles for the last few years, after spending 3 years creating 100s of them. It's a lot of work to keep up on that many, and honestly, when I see an editor who has never edited the article before come along and wipe out large portions of link sections I almost automatically assume it's vandalism, revert it, then move along.

 ==Discussion== 
 Against my word and yours we need to discuss this, civilly and calmly.  We are obviously going to get nowhere with snarky comments and edit warring.  So, how do you want to solve this?  At present, there is no consensus for either inclusion or non-inclusion, as it has no been actively discussed.  The inclusion is something that has just happened over time.  I feel we should have (at ANI for more eyes) a discussion on this and work something out.  We aren't going to get anywhere but blocked, both of us, if we continue to spit snarky comments at each other and revert each others edits.  So, truce? -  •  •  
 *Homer, I haven't yet forgotten that you called me a """"petty, arrogant troll""""on this same talk page. I make good-faith efforts to improve articles that you hadn't even edited before, and you are obviously following me and reverting me (blindly reverting me at WIAT also removed a valid maintenance template, and you know it). And no, I am not going to get blocked over this: every time you warn me about 3RR, you're the one at 3, not me.Now, there is progress in your message: you say there is no consensus for either inclusion or exclusion. By that I think you mean """"no consensus in the TV station project""""which is correct, but that's not all that matters.

 == Request for help/clarification == 

 Hi Vsion! 

 There was some misunderstanding between me and Huaiwei recently over my redirecting of Government of SIngapore article to Cabinet of Singapore article. It started off from Template:Politics of Singapore, which you did a superb job of revamping. There was a link """"Government departments"""" which was listed under """"Cabinet"""", and linked to Government of SIngapore. 

 My understanding of the word """"government"""" was obtained from the article Government: """"In British English, the word """"Government"""" can also be used to refer only to the executive branch, in this context being a synonym for the word """"administration"""" in American English (e.g. the Blair Government, the Bush Administration). In countries using the Westminster system the Government (or party in Government) will also useually control the legislature"""". I took it that """"government"""" was synonymous with """"cabinet"""" (since we do follow British English conventions). 

 In any case, I took it that you meant for """"Government departments"""" to be something closer to departments of the United Kingdom Government in Template:PoliticsUK, since it was placed as a sublist of """"cabinet"""". 

 I would appreciate it if you could have a look at Talk:Departments of the Singapore Government and Talk:Government of Singapore; this could potentially diffuse a very tense situation between the both of us!

 ::Atabəy, once again, let me repeat it for you - the source you've used as a reference, the Daily Bruin, next to the name of AACC to justify its inclusion, clearly states the name of the organization with the word California in it. So it appears it was the legal name at the time - and instead of faulting me or anyone here, you should then appeal to The Daily Bruin to have that """"corrected"""", if you believe it was wrong. So please take your tone and attacks somewhere else.  
 ::Meanwhile, something about Wikipedia - it goes by rules and citation of reliable and verifiable sources, it's not enough to just say that these and those said something somewhere. If you have references to early estimates by the Azerbaijani MFA or its embassy in US, please cite them and add them to the article. And in general, add as many reliable and verifiable references to that estimate as possible, the article would only benefit from it.  
 ::Also, you are again misunderstanding the US Census Bureau reference in the text - it was and is written in the context of US Azeris Network, which has expressed the 400,000 estimate publicly many times (including after being recognized by the US Census Bureau in 2009) in a verifiable fashion, and due to its being the first-ever Azerbaijani and Turkic organization to gain recognition from the US Census Bureau, it makes the estimate more reliable and authoritative (which was one of the points of contention here - user Alborz Fallah and others said that estimates from any Azerbaijani-American organizations cannot be deemed reliable and authoritative enough for Wikipedia article - thus through showing the recognition of the US Census Bureau, we put that contention to rest). The AACC does not appear to have any verifiable reference to the 400,000 done after it followed suit and also gained recognition from the US Census Bureau, hence it appears in that sentence to be out of context. In other words, reference to AACC does not belong there, much like there is no reference to other US Census Bureau organizations, like the US Turkic Network.

As long as you do the same witch what you’re talking it sounds like you’re going to 4real.

 :It is quite rude to change the title, or make substantial changes, while the discussion is ongoing. This comes out as edit warring. Per WP:BRD, the first time you're reverted, you were supposed to start the discussion on the talk page.

 :@Kwami, it is true that some English RS use """"Boris"""", but some also use """"Bidzina"""", e.g. Telegraph  or Guardian . He did use both names (although he seems to prefer """"Bidzina"""" now), and they are probably both acceptable titles, but we shouldn't tolerate apparent ethnic-motivated edit warring: I have a hunch that this article should come under purview of WP:ARBMAC.

The new millenium was celebrated across the world on midnight of December 31st 1999/January 1st 2000. In reality there probably should have been a year 0 (0 is as much a number as any other number), meaning the current year should be 2009.  
 In the same way an hour does not start one second after a minute, a millennium does not start one year after a decade.  

 At midnight 31st December 1999, every degree of time changed, so there was new second, minute, hour, day, week, month, year, decade. Why should millennium be any different. seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years and decades do not have a 0 value, eg seconds/mins/hrs is 1-59, days is 1-365, months is 1-21 and years start at 1, so everything that started at 1 changed to a new degree of time, therefore is makes sense that both decades and milleniums (which also both start at 1 not 0) would also start anew.
